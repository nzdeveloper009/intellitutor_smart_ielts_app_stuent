        "answer": "The piecharts show changes in American spending patterns between 1966 and 1996.<br><br>\n\nFood and cars made up the two biggest items of expenditure in both years. Together they comprised over half of household spending. Food accounted for 44% of spending in 1966, but this dropped by two thirds to 14% in 1996. However, the outlay on cars doubled, rising from 23% in 1966 to 45% in 1996.<br><br>\n\nOther areas changed significantly. Spending on eating out doubled, climbing from 7% to 14%. The proportion of salary spent on computers increased dramatically, up from 1% in 1996 to 10% in 1996. However, as computer expenditure rose, the percentage of outlay on books plunged from 6% to 1%.<br><br>\n\nSome areas remained relatively unchanged. Americans spent approximately the same amount of salary on petrol and furniture in both years.<br><br>\n\nIn conclusion, increased amounts spent on cars, computers, and eating out were made up for by drops in expenditure on food and books.",

        "answer": "This table shows the rise in passenger transport in Milan from 2010 to 2014 in the bus, train, tram, taxi and metro networks. There was increased usage of all 5 forms of transport during this period and the metro was used more than any other mode of transport.<br><br>\n\nIn 2010 there were just 7.3 million passengers using public transport in Milan, but by 2014 this figure had approximately doubled to over 14 million. The numbers rose for each form of transport every year with the exception of buses in 2011 when the figure dropped slightly from 1 million to 0.8 million. The pattern of change was mostly steady with the two greatest changes being the rise in bus usage in 2012 and metro usage in 2011, where there was an increase of around 1 million in both cases.<br><br>\n\nThe greatest number of passengers used the metro and trains, the figures rising from 3 million to 5 million and 1.4 million to 3.6 million respectively. While more people used trams at the start of this period, bus transport had become more popular by 2013. Taxis accounted for the fewest number of journeys at 0.6 to one million. ",

        "answer": "The line graph illustrates the average cost that American customers spent on mobile and landline phone services annually over a 10-year period.<br><br>\n\nOverall, spending on residential phone services dramatically declined, while popularity of mobile services increased sharply throughout a decade. Also, both of services met at the same record in 2006.<br><br>\n\nIn 2001, spending on mobile phone services began by merely $200, while the amount of annual expenditure on the residential phone services was around $700. Over the following five years, expenditure on landline phone services gradually dropped below $600, whereas expenditure on cell phone services rose to just over $500.<br><br>\n\nIn 2006 cell phones overtook landline phones, and the services became equal in popularity with customers' annual expenditure of about $550. Then, cell phone expenses rose to approximately $750 in 2010, making nearly a fourfold jump relatively to its initial figure in 2001. Meanwhile, spending on residential phone services experienced a steep fall in 2007 and went on to steadily decrease for the rest of the period.<br><br>\n\n<b>(168 words)</b>",

        "answer": "The two pie charts draw the conclusion of a survey of boys' and girls' cultural and leisure activities.<br><br>\n\nOverall, equal quantities of both sexes enjoyed listening to music, but a dramatically larger number of girls liked reading. There were also many differences in terms of the children's preferred sports.<br><br>\n\nTurning to the first chart, we can observe that boys prefer playing computer games (34% participation rate) than taking other activities. Playing basketball comes as the second most popular leisure, practiced by almost a third of male children. Basketball is followed by soccer, which is exercised by 17%. Skateboarding and listening to music are less preferable activities, chosen by 11% and 10% of boys respectively. Reading, the least popular cultural activity among boys, represents only two percent.<br><br>\n\nTaking a closer look at the second chart, we can see that girls' most preferred activity is dancing, being 27% of the total. In contrast to the boys' preferences, reading is chosen by more than a fifth of all girls. Although percentage of female children who play computer games is roughly twice less than that of boys (16%), this activity is third most popular on the girls' chart. With a slight difference between computer games and netball, the latter is practiced at 15% rate. Similarly to skateboarding popularity among boys, 11% of girls go in for gymnastics. Listening to music comes as the least popular leisure, with a proportion of 10%, equal to those on the first chart.<br><br>\n\n<b>(244 words)</b>",
