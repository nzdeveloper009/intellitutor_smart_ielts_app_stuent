        "answer": "Alternative medicine is not new. It is accepted that it pre-dates conventional medicine and it is still used by many people all over the world. I am unconvinced that it is dangerous, and feel that both alternative and conventional medicine can be useful.<br><br>\n\nThere are several reasons why the conventional medical community is often dismissive of alternatives.  Firstly, there has been little scientific research into such medicine, so there is a scarcity of evidence to support the claims of their supporters. Furthermore, people often try such treatment because of recommendations from friends, and therefore come to the therapist with a very positive attitude, which may be part of the reason for the cure. Moreover, these therapies are usually only useful for long-term, chronic conditions. Acute medical problems, such as accidental injury, often require more conventional methods.<br><br>\n\nOn the other hand, there remain strong arguments for the use of alternatives.  Despite the lack of scientific proof, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that these therapies work. In addition, far from being dangerous, they often have few or no side effects, so the worst outcome would be no change. One of the strongest arguments for the effectiveness of alternative therapies in the West is that, whilst conventional medicine is available without charge, many people are prepared to pay considerable sums for alternatives. If they were totally unhelpful, it would be surprising if this continued.<br><br>\n\nI strongly believe that conventional medicine and alternative therapies can and should coexist. They have different strengths, and can both be used effectively to target particular medical problems. The best situation would be for alternative therapies to be used to support and complement conventional medicine.<br><br>\n\n<b>(280 words)</b>",

        "answer": "Medical studies have shown that smoking not only leads to health problems for the smoker, but also for people close by. As a result of this, many believe that smoking should not be allowed in public places. Although there are arguments on both sides, I strongly agree that a ban is the most appropriate course of action.<br><br>\n\nOpponents of such a ban argue against it for several reasons. Firstly, they say that passive smokers make the choice to breathe in other people’s smoke by going to places where it is allowed. If they would prefer not to smoke passively, then they do not need to visit places where smoking is permitted. In addition, they believe a ban would possibly drive many bars and pubs out of business as smokers would not go there anymore. They also argue it is a matter of freedom of choice. Smoking is not against the law, so individuals should have the freedom to smoke where they wish.<br><br>\n\nHowever, there are more convincing arguments in favour of a ban. First and foremost, it has been proven that tobacco consists of carcinogenic compounds which cause serious harm to a person’s health, not only the smoker. Anyone around them can develop cancers of the lungs, mouth and throat, and other sites in the body. It is simply not fair to impose this upon another person. It is also the case that people’s health is more important than businesses. In any case, pubs and restaurants could adapt to a ban by, for example, allowing smoking areas . <br><br>\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that it should be made illegal to smoke in public places. This would improve the health of thousands of people, and that is most definitely a positive development.<br><br>\n\n<b>(290 words)</b>",

        "answer": "These days, more and more people are making the choice to go to university. While some people are of the opinion that the only purpose of a university education is to improve job prospects, others think that society and the individual benefit in much broader ways.<br><br>\n\nIt is certainly true that one of the main aims of university is to secure a better job. The majority of people want to improve their future career prospects and attending university is one of the best ways to do this as it increases a person's marketable skills and attractiveness to potential employers. In addition, further education is very expensive for many people, so most would not consider it if it would not provide them with a more secure future and a higher standard of living. Thus job prospects are very important.<br><br>\n\nHowever, there are other benefits for individuals and society. Firstly, the independence of living away from home is a benefit because it helps the students develop better social skills and improve as a person. A case in point is that many students will have to leave their families, live in halls of residence and meet new friends. As a result, their maturity and confidence will grow enabling them to live more fulfilling lives. Secondly, society will gain from the contribution that the graduates can make to the economy. We are living in a very competitive world, so countries need educated people in order to compete and prosper.<br><br>\n\nTherefore, I believe that although a main aim of university education is to get the best job, there are clearly further benefits.

        "answer": "Most foods that are purchased these days in small stores and supermarkets have chemicals in them as these are used to improve production and ensure the food lasts for longer. However, there are concerns that these have harmful effects.  In my opinion, the potential dangers from this are greater than the benefits we receive.<br><br>\n\nThere are several reasons why chemicals are placed in food. Firstly, it is to improve the product to the eye, and this is achieved via the use of colourings which encourage people to purchase food that may otherwise not look tempting to eat. Another reason is to preserve the food. Much of the food we eat would not actually last that long if it were not for chemicals they contain, so again this is an advantage to the companies that sell food as their products have a longer shelf life.<br><br>\n\nFrom this evidence, it is clear to me that the main benefits are, therefore, to the companies and not to the customer. Although companies claim these food additives are safe and they have research to support this, the research is quite possibly biased as it comes from their own companies or people with connections to these companies. It is common to read reports these days in the press about possible links to various health issues such as cancer. Food additives have also been linked to problems such as hyperactivity in children.<br><br>\n\nTo conclude, despite the fact that there are benefits to placing chemicals in food, I believe that these principally help the companies but could be a danger to the public. It is unlikely that this practice can be stopped, so food must be clearly labeled and it is my hope that organic products will become more readily available at reasonable prices to all.<br><br>\n\n<b>(Words 298)</b>",

        "answer": "Traffic congestion in many cities around the world is severe. One possible solution to this problem is to impose heavy taxes on car drivers and use this money to make public transport better. This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such a measure.<br><br>\n\nOne of the first benefits of such a measure is that the heavy taxes would discourage car owners from using their cars because it would become very expensive to drive. This would mean that they would begin to make use of public transport instead, thus reducing traffic problems and pollution as well. Another benefit would be that much more use would be made of public transport if it was improved. It is often the case that public transport in cities is very poor. For example, we often see old buses and trains that people would rather not use. High taxes would generate enough money to make the necessary changes.<br><br>\n\nNevertheless, there are drawbacks to such a solution. First and foremost, this would be a heavy burden on the car drivers. At present, taxes are already high for a lot of people, and so further taxes would only mean less money at the end of the month for most people who may have no choice but to drive every day. In addition, this type of tax would likely be set at a fixed amount. This would mean that it would hit those with less money harder, whilst the rich could likely afford it. It is therefore not a fair tax.<br><br>\n\nTo conclude, this solution is worth considering to improve the current situation, but there are advantages and disadvantages of introducing such a policy.<br><br>\n\n<b>(277 words)</b>",

        "answer": "While parents obviously play a major role in the way that their child develops as they get older, many people believe that social factors outside of the family now influence children much more. This essay will examine both sides of the argument. <br><br>\n\nThere is no doubt that there are factors external to the family that significantly impact on a child’s development.  For example, there is television and the internet. Children these days have access to these much more than they used to in the past, and they will pick up language and see things that will teach them about life. Friends also have an important influence as a child will often copy peers that they admire and respect. This could be positive behaviour but it could also be negative, such as smoking or taking drugs. <br><br>\n\nUltimately, however, it is family who have the most important impact. Children spend nearly all of their time with their family, especially in their early years. They develop their confidence, socialisation skills, morals, values and views on life through their interaction with them. Proof of the importance of this can be seen in the differences between some children. Those that grow up in a dysfunctional home often eventually have problems themselves, whilst those that are brought up in a warm and close environment end up more confident and secure in adult life.<br><br>\n\nTo conclude, it is the family that can provide a supportive, secure, and nurturing environment, which is crucial to the way in which a child becomes an adult. Although it is clear that social factors play a part, I would argue that it is the former that is the most important.<br><br>\n\n<b>(278 words)</b>",

        "answer": "Over the last few decades, many cities around the world have seen alarming increases in the levels of youth crime. This essay will discuss the reasons for this and provide some possible solutions.<br><br>\n\nThe first reason is connected with the family. In order for a child to grow up in a balanced way, it is very important that he or she is nurtured well by his or her parents. However, these days, it is often the case that children are neglected. This may be because of the fact that many parents in cities now both have to work so are often not around to give their children support when needed. Another factor is the increasing levels of poverty around the world. We have seen with globalization the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and this inevitably means that those who are poorer will have to resort to illegal means to get what others have. Of course, this will include the children in the poorer families.<br><br>\n\nHowever, there are ways to tackle such problems. Firstly, one of the ways to combat the problem is to have stricter punishments. Although, as discussed above, it can be outside factors that lead to crime, it is still important to have severe punishments to deter teenagers from crime. All too often, because they are young, the courts are too lenient. Parents also have to take more responsibility for their children’s actions. They too should be punished if their children commit crime.<br><br>\n\nTo sum up, several factors have led to increases in youth crime, but measures are available to tackle this problem.<br><br>\n\n<b>(267 words)</b>",

This essay will discuss the reasons for this phenomenon and examine some of the possible effects it will have on society.<br><br>\n\nOne of the principal reasons for smaller family units is birth control. As a country develops and becomes richer, birth control becomes more readily available. This may be due to a rise in the number of medical clinics or the distribution of free contraception. The result of this is that people can choose family size. Another important factor is the rise in the levels of education that occur as a country develops, which means that women are more educated and more likely to be working. Consequently, many will want to delay having children and so will likely have fewer in the long-term. <br><br>\n\nThis can impact on society in a number of ways. One positive effect is that the population will fall, which will likely result in less poverty as there will be less competition for scarce resources. The parents can also provide a better education to their children as it will cost less, which will benefit society as a whole. A possible negative impact is that there will be fewer younger people in the workforce in the future, thus making the sustainability of future economic growth less certain.<br><br>\n\nIn conclusion, family size has fallen due to birth control and education, and this can have positive and negative impacts on society.

While this can create problems, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the impacts.<br><br>\n\nThe main problem is that older people may find it more difficult to secure work, which arises because younger people are more likely to have up-to-date qualifications and experience. For example, information technology is integral to a variety of jobs these days and the skills needed for this are rapidly changing. Young people may well have recent knowledge through university or through using technology in their leisure time. If older people cannot secure work, this leads to other problems. As they are likely to have a family to support, they may not have an adequate income to provide for their children’s education or other such necessities.<br><br>\n\nIt is the government that needs to take measures to ameliorate such problems. This needs to begin with ensuring that older people have all the skills needed to compete in the job market, which could be achieved by providing free training on the most important job requirements at local community colleges, for example. In addition to this, the government needs to encourage employers to change their employment practices by promoting the value of experience that older workers can bring to a job.<br><br>\n\nTo conclude, the main issue with competition for work between these groups is that older people may start to find it more difficult to find work.

Although I agree that it is important to spend money on public services, I do not think spending on the arts is a waste of money.<br><br>\n\nThere are several reasons for spending a significant amount of the government budget on public services. First and foremost, public services are the things such as hospitals, roads and schools, and these things determine the quality of life that most of us will have. For example, if the government does not spend enough money on hospitals, the health of our society may decline. Similarly, if not enough money is spent on schools, our children may not be properly educated. Also, it will be the poor in our society that will be affected more if we do not spend enough on these things because they are the ones more dependent on such services.<br><br>\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the arts should be completely neglected. To begin, it is difficult for many arts institutions to generate much profit, so without some help from the government, many theatres and other such places may have to close.

Many people get great pleasure in going to see music and theatre performances so it is important that the government assists such institutions so that they can continue to provide entertainment to the public.<br><br>\n\nTo sum up, there are clear benefits of ensuring a large amount of investment goes into public services as this influences the quality of life for nearly all of us.

This essay will discuss both points of view.<br><br>\n\nWith regard to the exploitation of animals, people believe it is acceptable for several reasons. Firstly, they think that humans are the most important beings on the planet, and everything must be done to ensure human survival. If this means experimenting on animals so that we can fight and find cures for diseases, then this takes priority over animal suffering. Furthermore, it is believed by some that animals do not feel pain or loss as humans do, so if we have to kill animals for food or other uses, then this is morally acceptable.<br><br>\n\nHowever, I do not believe these arguments stand up to scrutiny. To begin, it has been shown on numerous occasions by secret filming in laboratories via animal rights groups that animals feel as much pain as humans do, and they suffer when they are kept in cages for long periods. In addition, a substantial amount of animal research is done for cosmetics, not to find cures for diseases, so this is unnecessary. Finally, it has also been proven that humans can get all the nutrients and vitamins that they need from green vegetables and fruit. Therefore, again, having to kill animals for food is not an adequate argument.<br><br>\n\nTo sum up, although some people argue killing animals for research and food is ethical, I would argue there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that this is not the case, and, therefore, steps must be taken to improve the rights of animals.<br><br>\n\n<b>(Words 290)</b>",

        "answer": "People work hard and earn money which ideally they would like to retain for themselves. However, a significant portion of this usually has to be given to the state. In my view, it is right that people pay their fair share of taxes. <br><br>\n\nMoney is everything in today’s livelihoods. This is because money is used to buy all the necessities such as food, water, and shelter. Money is also used to help a family’s children in the form of school fees and other activities. In addition to this, people do not only need money to cater for their necessities, but also for future investments. The more that people have to invest, the more they believe they can accumulate in the long term. As a result, many are reluctant to lose some of their income through the deduction of tax. <br><br>\n\nNevertheless, citizens should be obliged to pay taxes to the government for a number of reasons. They should accept that the taxes they pay help the government offer them the public services all over the country. These public services are things such as the construction of roads, bridges, public hospitals, parks and other public services. The same tax money helps the country’s economy to be stable. Through taxes, the government can pay off its debts. In short, tax money is a way of ensuring that people have comfortable livelihoods.<br><br>\n\nIn conclusion, even though many people think that they should not pay taxes, that money is useful to the stability of any country. Therefore, people should not avoid paying taxes as it may affect the country’s economy and services that it provides. <br><br>\n\n<b>(270 Words)</b>",

        "answer": "Over the last decade there has been a massive rise in the level of crime committed by teenagers in a number of countries.  It is important to establish why this has happened and to look at ways to solve the problem.<br><br>\n\nOne reason is the <b>break down in the nuclear family</b>. The high divorce rates have meant many children have been brought up in one-parent families with no father to act as a role model which is detrimental to their development.  This is particularly important for boys, who without this guidance are easily led astray by bad influences such as drugs and crime.  Another factor is the <b>lack of things to do</b> for the young. For example, in the UK, many television programs about this issue have shown that teenagers hang around in the evenings with little to do.  When this happens, the boredom means they will find their own entertainment, which is often crime.<br><br>\n\nThere are, however, ways to tackle these problems.  Firstly, the <b>government should provide more support for families</b>.  They could, for instance, invest more into building and staffing youth centers which would provide guidance through the youth workers and also enable teenagers to focus their attention on sport and other activities.   <b>Parents should also be encouraged to take more responsibility for their children</b>.  Ultimately, the onus is on them to ensure their children are brought up in a loving environment which would make them less likely to turn to crime.  They could, for example, find a male relative to act as a role model.<br><br>\n\nTherefore, it is clear that there are various reasons for this rise in crime, but solutions are available.  If we begin to tackle the issue now, we may be able to prevent the situation declining further.<br><br>\n<b>(294 Words)</b>",

While some people are of the opinion that the only purpose of a university education is to improve job prospects, others think that society and the individual benefit in much broader ways.<br><br>\n\nIt is certainly true that one of the main aims of university is to secure a better job.  To begin, the majority of people want to improve their future career prospects.  Attending university is one of the best ways to do this as it increases your marketable skills and your attractiveness to potential employers.  For example, in Europe, further education is very expensive for many people, so most would not consider it if it would not provide them with a more secure future and a higher standard of living.  Also, universities have their reputation to consider.  They definitely want to ensure that their students are going to get the best jobs as this will affect future funding and university applications. <br><br>\n\nHowever, there are other benefits for individuals and society.  Firstly, the independence of living away from home is a benefit because it helps the students develop better social skills and improve as a person.  Many students, for instance, will have to leave their families, live in halls of residence and meet new friends.  As a result, their maturity and confidence will grow enabling them to live more fulfilling lives.  Secondly, society will gain from the contribution that the graduates can make to the economy.  We are living in a very competitive world, so countries, especially developing countries, need educated people in order to compete and prosper.<br><br>\n\nTo conclude, I believe that although a main aim of university education is to get the best job, there are clearly further benefits.  If we continue to promote and encourage university attendance, it will lead to a better future for everyone.<br><br>\n<b>(279 words)</b>",

Migrant workers have always been attracted by the wider choice of employment and greater opportunity in major cities in their own countries and abroad. Recently, as the technological age has advanced and as richer countries find themselves with not enough workers to feed their development, they have had to run to other parts of the world to find the necessary manpower. Many richer European countries, for example, are now trying to attract skilled IT workers from my home country India by offering higher salaries than they could hope to earn at home. With the globalisation of the world economy, many people feel that the process cannot be stopped.<br><br>\n\nOthers, myself included, are of the opinion that measures should be taken to address the problem, by compensating poorer countries financially for the loss of investment in the people they have trained, like doctors and nurses. Admittedly, this may be cumbersome to administer, but an attempt could be made to get it off the ground. Another step, which in part has already begun to happen, is to use the forces of globalization itself. Western countries could encourage people to stay in their own countries by direct investment in projects like computer factories or by sending patients abroad for treatment, as is already happening.<br><br>\n\nIt is obviously difficult to restrict the movement of people around the world and it is probably foolish to try to stop it, but attempts should be made to redress the imbalance.<br><br>\n<b>(291 words)</b>",

        "answer": "The growth of the fast food industry has, without doubt, impacted on the eating habits and the health of many societies around the world. Diabetes, high cholesterol, heart and respiratory problems are all on the rise due to fatty and sugar-rich food. However, the question is whether higher tax would improve this situation or not.<br><br>\n\nFrom an economic point of view, higher tax might seem sensible. In countries such as the USA, Australia and Britain, the healthcare system spends a large part of its budget on people with diet-related health problems. It could be argued that these people have caused their own illnesses because of their choice of food. In this case, why should they expect the state to pay for their treatment? The tax could help fund the healthcare system.<br><br>\n\nHowever, we also need to consider which socio-economic group consumes fast food as the main part of their diet. Statistics indicate that lower income groups eat more of this food than wealthier people. One possible reason for this is that fast food is far cheaper than fresh produce. This is because many governments offer large subsidies to farmers who provide products for the fast food industry, such as corn, wheat and beef. Fruit and vegetables, on the other hand, are not subsidised. Research suggests that many families simply cannot afford to buy healthy food or pay higher taxes on fast food. For them, fast food is not a choice but a necessity.<br><br>\n\nIn conclusion, imposing a higher tax on fast food does not seem to be the answer. If the government chose to do this, it would only lead to greater poverty and families facing further hardship.<br><br>\n\n<b>(278 words)</b>",

        "answer": "Crime is an issue of increasing concern around the world, and more money than ever before is being spent on the detection and punishment of criminal activity. The reasons why people commit crime are countless, but drugs and alcohol, social problems and poverty play a major role. To solve these problems, governments can either focus on draconian punishments, or improve employment opportunities, invest in good housing projects and tackle drug and alcohol abuse.<br><br>\n\nOne of the main causes of criminality is the use, sale and trafficking of narcotics. For example, the sale of drugs is organised by armed criminal gangs who illegally traffic drugs and control their business with extreme violence. Drug-related crime does not end there; drug users often steal to fund theft habit, resulting in further acts of petty crime. The social problems connected with crime are said to be the result of single-parent families, absent role models and bad living conditions. The children from these broken families often become criminals because they feel alienated from society. Poverty is also a reason behind crime. When unskilled jobs pay so little and prices are so high, it's easy to see why some turn to crime for an income.<br><br>\n\nCrime can of, course, be dealt with by toughening criminal laws and introducing longer custodial sentences for persistent criminals, but some of the best ways to deal with crime may be to deal with the social causes. Increasing employment opportunities in poorer areas would improve living standards, which would mean access to affordable housing and education. Government funding for drug and alcohol rehabilitation programmes would help reduce dependency on stimulants and the need for the criminal activity that surrounds them.<br><br>\n\nIn conclusion, crime is a major issue, but cracking down on offenders with a harsh penal system is not the only way. These problems can be solved through the government providing jobs and funding which should raise living standards and dramatically reduce crime levels.<br><br>\n\n<b>(323 words)</b>",

The question of what we can do to prevent global climate change and whether individual action is effective or not is a hotly debated issue.<br><br>\n\nThere are those who say that the majority of the damages is wrought by big businesses. By imposing restrictions on emissions and by strictly monitoring waste disposal from factories, plants and businesses, governments would go a long way towards preventing climate change. It is thought that governments around the world should come up with solutions to help prevent imminent environment disaster. Proponents of this view claim that individual action is irrelevant in the face of massive, wide-scale prevention policies set and controlled by governments.<br><br>\n\nOn the other hand, there are a growing number of people who believe that individual action combined with governmental and business action will do a lot more to prevent climate change than if individual citizens were not involved. In a world of six billion people, if everyone thought about the number of water they use, how they dispose of their rubbish, whether or not something needs to be thrown away or if they can, in fact, re-use certain items then we would be giving the problem of climate change and its prevention a massive boost.<br><br>\n\nTaking both points into consideration, I firmly believe that individual citizens cannot sit back and say it is someone else’s responsibility to protect the environments; we must all play our part-individual citizens, governments and big businesses alike.<br><br>\n\n<b>(264 words)</b>",

        "answer": "Most people today would like travel in different places. A few decades ago, only the rich can afford to travel since they can spend more. There are several reasons why the number of travellers have been increasing.<br><br>\n\nFirst, there is a healthy competition in the transport industry. Long ago, there are only few airline companies so they control and monopolize the industry. Today there are a lot of airline companies and this is the reason why the price of airfare became affordable. Airline companies, nowadays, have their own websites so that it can entice new customers to use their services. They also lowered the ticket prices by developing promotional fares which is beneficial for the customers. Another reason is convenience. People today can use the internet to search their preferred tourist destination. They can also view the best route to maximize the cost of travel and time. Electronic maps are also available in the internet.<br><br>\n\nThere are several benefits that a traveller can get through travelling. Initially, the traveller can eat some exotic foods and see new sights. The individual can also experience new culture and traditions. These new experiences can give the traveller new insights on life and the environment.<br><br>\n\nIn my own experience, visiting Thailand with my mother was such a wonderful experience. I was hesitant at first because I knew beforehand that ticket prices for that destination are pricey. I changed my mind when I saw the promotional fare of Cebu Pacific in their website. After we booked the flight, I then searched the internet for our hotel accomodations. We really enjoyed the trip when we visited some Buddhist temple.<br><br>\n\nTo sum it up, more people would like to travel because of its advantages.

        "answer": "It is certainly true that the more people nowadays do not have a close relationship with their neighbours and that this has weakened communities in our cities. This is probably due to a combination of our more mobile society and the nature of new building developments and is a problem that will require better  planning policies.<br><br>\n\nOne main cause of this change is the trend for people to move home to find work. This mobility means that there is less chance for people to put down roots in a community and establish relationships with their neighbours. If, for example, a person moves city once every five years then it is most unlikely that they will form lasting relationships where they live.<br><br>\n\nAnother important factor is that when people move into a new area they often live in apartment blocks and not houses. This matters because these blocks do not have common social areas where people can meet each other in the same way as is possible in more traditional housing estates. It is possible for people who live in these new high rise buildings never to see each other, still less get to know each other well enough to form a bond.<br><br>\n\nAny solution to this problem will probably involve local government adopting planning policies that are focused on the community. While it is unlikely that anything can be done about social mobility, it is possible for local authorities to encourage a greater sense of community by ensuring new building developments have social spaces where people can meet each other regularly. These could include green spaces where children can play together, local markets and community halls.\n\nMy conclusion is that there may be nothing to be done about social mobility but it is possible for local government to foster a greater sense of community by ensuring new developments are more community friendly.",

        "answer": "Digital technology <b>has without question</b> changed the way we read and access books and this threatens the role of the public library. <b>My view is that while there is a good argument for saying  libraries are much less relevant nowadays, they still perform a vital function and should be be maintained.</b><br><br>\n\n<b>The advance of online reading technologies and services is one compelling argument in favour of limiting any funding public libraries </b>. It is now possible to not just buy almost any book you want online through stores such as Amazon, you are also able to borrow books for a small subscription fee from various sites. Indeed, these online services are generally much more comprehensive and reliable than any provided by a local library where you can often have to wait weeks for the book you want. <b>In these circumstances,</b> it is quite possible to argue that public libraries are out of date and have been largely overtaken by technology.<br><br>\n\n<b>Despite this, public libraries do still have some role to play and it would be a mistake to abolish them entirely. </b>One such role is lending books to children and encouraging children to acquire the reading habit books by having schemes that reward them for borrowing books on a regular basis. Many parents who are anxious about the amount of screen time their children have would much prefer to visit a library where they can more closely monitor the books their children are taking out. Another important role public libraries perform is stocking a wide range of reference books and more specialised books  that are typically not available via online services. While these services may be limited, they still matter and show that libraries still perform an important function.<br><br>\n\n<b>My conclusion is a mixed one.</b> On the one hand, I believe it is true that nearly all the function of libraries have been replaced by digital technology, but in some areas, namely children’s books and reference books, public libraries do have a role to play.",

Two sentences can be enough. I clearly identify the topic of the question and establish my own position. An alternative approach would be to use 3 sentences to say:<br><br>\n\n1.

The first is about society and crime, the second family and home life and the third about work.<br><br>\n\nNote also that each paragraph starts with a clear (and quite short) sentence stating what the problem/main point is. I develop that point in the other sentences with reasons and examples that relate to young adults.<br><br>\n\nConclusion<br><br>\n\nThe conclusion matches the introduction closely. This is a good idea. I don’t introduce any new points I re-state my point of view and quickly summarise the main points: society/family/work<br><br>\n\n<b>Notes on vocabulary and ideas</b><br><br>\n\nVocabulary<br><br>\n\nThis essay is about young adults and playing computer games. I have highlighted in red and blue the words and phrases I use for these ideas. You should see:<br><br>\n\nthere is quite a lot of repetition – this is not a bad thing provided there is also some variety. It can help to repeat words and phrases to help the examiner see what you are talking about. This is part of cohesion.<br><br>\n\nthere is also variety – I don’t try too hard here for “clever words” I  vary the form of words quite a lot (e.g. addiction and addicted) – this is smart.<br><br>\n\nSome of the best vocabulary comes in the use of examples. I use collocations such as<br><br>\n\nrespect human life<br><br>\n\nbuild a lasting relationship<br><br>\n\nprovide an example to<br><br>\n\nloss of concentration<br><br>\n\ncommit crimes<br><br>\n\nestablish a relationship<br><br>\n\nstart families<br><br>\n\nThis is a useful model for you to follow. It is language like this that impresses.<br><br>\n\nIdeas<br><br>\n\nI did have more ideas for this essay but I concentrated on 2/3. You should see how each paragraph is a separate idea. I then develop that idea briefly with a reason and examples that clearly relate to young adults:<br><br>\n\nIdea 1<br><br>\n\nproblem for society – connection between violent games and crime – young adults play these games most<br><br>\n\nIdea 2<br><br>\n\nproblem for individual – people who play games are bad at relationships – young adults are building relationships<br><br>\n\nIdea 3<br><br>\n\nproblem for individual – games addiction bad for performance at work – young adults are starting jobs<br><br>\n\nI found these ideas by thinking of the word “addiction” and then asking “when” why” “where” ‘how”. This is a technique I discuss in this lesson on finding ideas.<br><br>\n\nIf you run out of ideas you can make them up!!! This can work well when you need an example to prove a point. In this essay I talk about evidence for gaming causing crime. I don’t have it. That’s not a problem.<br><br>\n\nMore ideas\n\nThere are more ideas I didn’t use in this essay. Here are a few positive ideas for you to think about.<br><br>\n\nDifferent types of games:<br><br>\n\nsome games are creative e.g. city building games can be seen as positive as they build important skills and provide information about how society works relevant to young adults<br><br>\n\nsome games are educational e.g. language based games that can help educate young adults who may have a poor educational background<br><br>\n\nGaming communities: people meet other people by playing games online – another positive<br><br>\n\n<b>Notes on coherence and cohesion</b><br><br>\n\nStructure<br><br>\n\nThis essay is extremely coherent. I identify my position in the introduction and say that it is a problem for both society and the individual. The first content paragraph talks about the society problem (crime) and the following paragraphs talk about individual problems (family and work).<br><br>\n\nParallel words/structures and synonyms<br><br>\n\nNote how the different content paragraphs start with similar phrases. It can help to borrow language from one paragraph to another.<br><br>\n\nThe dangers to<br><br>\n\nThe problems that<br><br>\n\nAnother set of problems<br><br>\n\nare parallel words/structures that show the examiner that I am writing about something similar but different in each paragraph. Note how I vary these words and don’t just repeat them. Note too how I vary clear and apparent – two words that mean the same thing:<br><br>\n\nare clear<br><br>\n\nare equally apparent<br><br>\n\nThis is helps the examiner see that I am linking ideas together.<br><br>\n\nReasons and examples<br><br>\n\nIn each paragraph I use reasons and examples. Both content paragraphs 1/2 follow a PEE pattern – where I say something, explain it and give an example. You might note how I use “evidence” to provide examples.

        "answer": "There can be little doubt that more and more people are becoming addicted to computer games and this is especially true for young adults. My view is this is a dangerous development for both society and the people concerned.<br><br>\n\nThe dangers to society of computer gaming addiction among young adults are clear. There is strong evidence to show that there is a connection between violent crime and playing games that do not respect human life. It has been shown for instance that while there is little harm in a few hours of recreational gaming a week, people who spend many hours a day at their gaming consoles are much more likely to commit crimes. This is particularly true of young men in their twenties and thirties who are typically the section of society who become most addicted to games.<br><br>\n\nThe problems that too much gaming can cause young adults as individuals are equally apparent. One particular problem is that they are at a stage of life when they need to concentrate on establishing relationships and perhaps starting families. Again there is evidence to show that people who play too many games find it more difficult to build a lasting relationship and if they do, they provide a poor example to their children.<br><br>\n\nAnother set of problems that gaming addiction can cause in this age bracket is at work. This is because too much gaming can cause loss of concentration and that in turn can lead to reduced efficiency in the workplace. This is of course a problem for the company and may also lead to the individual failing to get promotion or even being fired.<br><br>\n\nIn conclusion my own view is very clear. The growth of the gaming habit among young adults can have negative effects for society as a whole and individuals both at home and at work.",

        "answer": "It is, of course, important for people to earn a sufficiently high salary to support their lifestyle. This does not mean, however, that the salary is the only point to be taken into consideration when choosing a job. Indeed, I would argue that there are a number of other factors that are equally significant.<br><br>\n\nThe first point to consider is why it may be a mistake to place too much emphasis on the salary. One reason why this is so is that you may select a job that is well-paid but ultimately unsatisfying. In this case, you may spend 8 hours a day being unhappy. Something else to be taken into account is that highly-paid jobs tend to be stressful and involve long working hours. For instance, many doctors have a 60 hour working week and they often suffer from burn-out early in their careers and wish they had chosen a less stressful profession.<br><br>\n\nThe other point to be taken into account is how other factors may matter more than the salary when deciding on a job. Indeed, most people would accept that the work environment is key to job satisfaction. If you are working alongside people you like and the atmosphere in the office is positive, you are much more likely to be satisfied in your work. Likewise, it is also critical that you actually enjoy what you do. For example, someone who is artistic is much more likely to be happy working for a low salary teaching art than earning a fortune as a merchant banker.<br><br>\n\nIn conclusion, I would say that the salary should be only one consideration in choosing a job and that other factors such as job satisfaction and work environment are just as important.",

        "answer": "Immigration has a significant impact on the contemporary society. Each year, more and more people from all over the world decide to leave their home countries and move to another place. This essay will examine the reasons and the consequences of immigration.<br><br>\n\nIn my view, the main reason of immigration is a strong desire of better life quality and safe future. A lot of people from so-called Third World move to developed countries in search of better employment opportunities, and therefore, higher incomes. Moreover, living in a wealthy country implies living in a country with stable economy, so risks of losing their savings also lessen. For example, labour migration from Mexico to the USA is caused by these facts. Other reasons that force whole families to cross borders are wars and various cultural conflicts in their homeland. Many people migrate, seeking security and safe future for their children. For instance, most of the refugees who arrived in the European Union were escaping from wars.<br><br>\n\nHowever, sometimes immigration causes more problems than it solves, resulting in negative consequences for both immigrants and their countries of destination. First of all, most of the refugees can’t find jobs because of the lack of language skills and difficulties in adaptation. That’s why the countries have to run various refugee assistance programs to help those people. But disproportionate burden of maintaining the immigrants leads to tension in the society. Secondly, not all of the refugees receive proper asylum, food and medical care. So they are at risk even after crossing the border. Finally, even highly qualified specialists, who seek better employment, often don’t get what they are looking for.<br><br>\n\nIn conclusion, I think that people immigrate to have better life prospects. However, life after immigration may not always meet people’s expectations. So it’s very important to consider all the possible outcomes and decide whether leaving your homeland is worth it.<br><br>\n\n<b>(315 words)</b>\n",

        "answer": "It is often argued that it is more advantageous to choose a job with high wage, even if it doesn't appeal to you at all. I completely disagree with this opinion and think that job satisfaction is much more important than salary.<br><br>\n\nFirst of all, I believe that job satisfaction gives people a sense of fulfillment that no money can guarantee. Even if someone is earning a high salary, but feels tensed and compromises with his conscience, this person won’t enjoy his life. While pursuing one’s interests will always bring pleasure and feeling of satisfaction. For example, a lot of famous researchers made their career choices not because of appealing wages, but because they were passionate about science. That’s why it’s more important to choose the kind of work that makes you happy than to look only at a high salary.<br><br>\n\nSecondly, doing what you like keeps you motivated and therefore leads to a career growth. In other words, there is a strong relation between job satisfaction and productivity. People who love their jobs can easily excel in their fields of work and achieve better results than those, who put salary on the first place. For instance, Henry Miller decided to leave his everyday job despite a good wage and ventured to become a writer. And after enduring years of ups and downs he became one of the most famous and well-paid authors of the twentieth century. Thus, advantages of jobs that keep you satisfied outweigh the drawback of a low salary in a long-term perspective.<br><br>\n\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that job satisfaction is more beneficial than high salary because it makes people happy and motivated.<br><br>\n\n<b>(277 words)</b>",
