<p>The <b>past perfect tense</b> is quite an easy tense to understand and to use. This tense talks about the "past in the past".</p>
<p><font color="purple">How do we make the Past Perfect Tense?</font></p>
<p>The structure of the past perfect tense is:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th>subject</th>
<th >+</th>
<th >auxiliary verb HAVE</th>
<th >+</th>
<th >main verb</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" rowspan="2" style="text-align:center" bgcolor="Wheat"></td>
<td>conjugated in simple past tense</td>
<td rowspan="2" style="text-align:center" bgcolor="Wheat"></td>
<td>past participle</td>
</tr>
<tr >
<td>had</td>
<td>V3</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>For negative sentences in the past perfect tense, we insert <b>not</b>. between the auxiliary
verb and main verb. For question sentences, we exchange the <b>subject</b> and<b> auxiliary verb</b>. Look at these
 example sentences with the past perfect tense:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th ></th>
<th >subject</th>
<th >auxillary verb</th>
<th ></th>
<th >main verb</th>
<th ></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+</td>
<td>I</td>
<td>had</td>
<td></td>
<td>finished</td>
<td>my work</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+</td>
<td>You</td>
<td>had</td>
<td></td>
<td>stopped</td>
<td>before me</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-</td>
<td>She</td>
<td>had</td>
<td>not</td>
<td >gone</td>
<td>to school</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-</td>
<td>We</td>
<td>had</td>
<td>not</td>
<td>left</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>?</td>
<td>Had</td>
<td>you</td>
<td></td>
<td>arrived?</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>?</td>
<td>Had</td>
<td>they</td>
<td></td>
<td>eaten</td>
<td>dinner</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>When speaking with the past perfect tense, we often contract the subject and auxiliary verb:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th>I had</th>
<th>I'd</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>you had</td>
<td>you'd</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>he had
<br>she had</br>
<br>it had</br>
</td>
<td>he'd
<br>she'd</br>
<br>it'd</br>
</td>
<tr>
<td>we had</td>
<td>we'd</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>they had</td>
<td>they'd</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The <b>'d</b> contraction is also used for the auxiliary verb <b>would</b>. For example, <b>we'd</b> can mean: </p>
<li>We <b>had</b></li>
<br>or
<li>We <b>would</b></li>
<p>But usually the main verb is in a different form, for example: </p>
<li>We had <b>arrived</b> (past participle) </li>
<li>We would<b> arrive</b> (base) </li>
<p>It is always clear from the context.</p>
<p><font color="purple">How do we use the Past Perfect Tense?</font></p>
<p>The past perfect tense expresses action in the <b>past</b> before another action in the <b>past</b>. This is the <b>past in the past</b> For example:</p>
<li>The train left at 9am. We arrived at 9.15am. When we arrived, the train<b> had left</b>. </li>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" >
<tr>
<th colspan="3" style="text-align:center" bgcolor="Wheat">The train had left when we arrived.</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th ><b>past</b></th>
<th ><b>present</b></th>
<th ><b>future</b></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Train leaves in past at 9am.</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3" style="text-align:center" bgcolor="Wheat">9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We arrive in past at 9.15am.</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table>
Look at some more examples:
<li>I wasn't hungry. I <b>had</b> just <b>eaten</b>. </li>
<li>They were hungry. They <b>had</b> not <b>eaten</b> for five hours.</li>
<li>I didn't know who he was. I <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> him before. </li>
<li>"Mary wasn't at home when I arrived."</li>
<p>"Really? Where <b>had</b> she <b>gone</b>?" </p>
<p>You can sometimes think of the past perfect tense like the present perfect tense, but instead of the time being <b>now </b>the time is <b>past</b>.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th colspan="3" style="text-align:center">past perfect tense</th>
<th style="text-align:center" bgcolor="BurlyWood"></th>
<th colspan="3" style="text-align:center">present perfect tense</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>had
<br>done</br>
<br></br></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>have
<br>done</br>
<br>></br></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>past</td>
<td>now</td>
<td>future</td>
<td></td>
<td>past</td>
<td>now</td>
<td>future</td>
</tr>

<p>For example, imagine that you arrive at the station at 9.15am. The stationmaster says to you:</p>
<li>"You <b>are</b> too late. The train <b>has left.</b>" </li>
<p>Later, you tell your friends:</p>
<li>"We <b>were </b>too late. The train <b>had left.</b>" </li>
<p>We often use the past perfect tense in reported speech after verbs like<b> said, told, asked, thought, wondered:</b></p>
<p>Look at these examples:</p>
<li>He told us that the train<b> had left</b></li> 
<li>I thought I <b>had met </b>her before, but I was wrong. </li>
<li>He explained that he<b> had closed </b>the window because of the rain.</li>
<li>I wondered if I <b>had been </b>there before. </li>
<li>I asked them why they <b>had</b> not <b>finished</b>. </li>
