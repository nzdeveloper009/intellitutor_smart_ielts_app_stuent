<p>The <b>past continuous tense</b> is an important tense in English. We use it to say what we were in the middle of doing at a particular moment in the past.</p>
<p><font color="purple">How do we make the Past Continuous Tense?</font></p>
<p>The structure of the past continuous tense is:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th >subject</th>
<th >+</th>
<th>auxiliary verb BE</th>
<th >+</th>
<th >main verb</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" colspan="2" ></td>
<td >conjugated in simple past tense</td>
<td rowspan="2"></td>
<td >present participle</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >was
<br>were</br></td>
<td >base + ing</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>For negative sentences in the past continuous tense, we insert<b> not </b>between the auxiliary verb and main verb. For question sentences, we exchange the <b>subject</b> and <b>auxiliary verb.</b> Look at these example sentences with the past continuous tense:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" >
<tr>
<th ></th>
<th><b>subject</b></th>
<th ><b>auxillary verb</b></th>
<th ></th>
<th ><b>main verb</b></th>
 <th ></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >+</td>
<td >I</td>
<td >was</td>
<td ></td>
<td >watching</td>
<td >TV</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >+</td>
<td >You</td>
<td >were</td>
<td ></td>
<td >working</td>
<td >hard</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td ></td>
<td >He, she, it</td>
<td >was</td>
<td >not</td>
<td >helping</td>
<td >Mary</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td ></td>
<td >We</td>
<td >were</td>
<td >not</td>
<td >joking</td>
<td ></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >?</td>
<td >Were</td>
<td >you</td>
<td ></td>
<td >being</td>
<td >silly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >?</td>
<td >Were</td>
<td >they</td>
<td ></td>
<td >playing</td>
<td >football?</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><font color="purple">How do we use the Past Continuous Tense?</font></p>
<p>The past continuous tense expresses action at a <b>particular moment</b> in the past. The action started before that moment but has not finished at that moment. For example, yesterday I watched a film on TV. The film started at 7pm and finished at 9pm.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th><b>past</b></th><th><b>present future</b></th>

</tr>
<tr><td>
At 8pm yesterday, I was watching TV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</td><td>At 8pm, I was in the middle of watching TV	.
</td></table>
<p>When we use the past continuous tense, our listener usually knows or understands what time we are talking about. Look at these examples:</p>
<li>I was working at 10pm last night. </li>
<li>They <b>were</b> not <b>playing </b>football at 9am this morning. </li>
<li>What <b>were </b>you <b>doing</b> at 10pm last night?  </li>
<li> What<b> were</b> you <b>doing </b>when he arrived?  </li>
<li>She<b> was cooking </b>when I telephoned her. </li>
<li>We <b>were having</b> dinner when it started to rain. </li>
<li>Ram went home early because it<b> was snowing.</b> </li>
<p><b><u>Some verbs cannot be used </u></b>in</p>
<p>continuous/progressive tenses.</p>
<p>We often use the past continuous tense to "set the scene" in stories. We use it to describe the background situation at the moment when the action begins. Often, the story starts with the past continuous tense and then moves into the simple past tense. Here is an example:</p>
<p>" James Bond was <b>driving</b> through town. It <b>was raining</b>. The wind was <b>blowing </b>hard. Nobody <b>was walking </b>in the streets. Suddenly, Bond saw the killer in a telephone box..."</p>
<p><font color="purple">Past Continuous Tense + Simple Past Tense</font></p>
<p>We often use the past continuous tense with the simple past tense. We use the past continuous tense to express a <b>long</b> action. And we use the simple past tense to express a <b>short </b>action that happens <b>in the middle</b> of the long action. We can join the two ideas with<b> when</b> or<b> while</b>.</p>
<p>In the following example, we have two actions:</p>
<p>1. long action (watching TV), expressed with past continuous tense</p>
<p> 2. short action (telephoned), expressed with simple past tense </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th ><b>past</b></th>
<th ><b>present</b></th>
<th ><b>future</b></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >Long action.</td>
<td ></td>
<td ></td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align:center"bgcolor="gold">
	<td >
	<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
		<tr>
<td >I was watching TV at 8pm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >8pm</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >You telephoned at 8pm.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<tr>
<th >Short action.</th>
<th ></th>
<th ></th>
</tr>
</table>
<p>We can join these two actions with<b> when</b>:</p>
<li>I was watching TV when you telephoned. </li>
<p>(Notice that "when you telephoned" is also a way of defining the time [8pm].)</p>
<p>We use:</p>
<li><b>when + short action</b> (simple past tense) </li>
<li><b>while + long action</b> (past continuous tense)  </li>
<p>There are four basic combinations:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th ></th>
<th >I was walking past the car</th>
<th ><b>when</b></th>
<th >it exploded.</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td ><b>when</b></td>
<td >the car exploded</td>
<td ></td>
<td >I was walking past it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td ></td>
<td >The car exploded</td>
<td ><b>while</b></td>
<td >I was walking past it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td ><b>While</b></td>
<td >I was walking past the car</td>
<td ></td>
<td >it exploded.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Notice that the <b>long action</b> and <b>short action</b> are relative.</p>
<li>Notice that the long action and short action are relative.</li>
<li>"Walking past the car" took a few seconds. "Exploded" took a few milliseconds</li>
