<br>We often use the present perfect tense to talk about a <b>continuing situation</b>. This is a state that started in the<b> past </b>and continues in the <b>present</b> (and will probably continue into the future). This is a<b> state</b> (not an action). We usually use<b>for</b> or <b>since</b> with this structure.<br>
