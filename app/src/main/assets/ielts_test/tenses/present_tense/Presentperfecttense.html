The problems come with the<b>use</b> of the tense. In addition, there are some differences in usage between British and American English.</br>

<br><font color="purple">Contractions with the present perfect tense</font></br>
<br>When we use the present perfect tense in speaking, we usually contract the subject and auxiliary verb. We also sometimes do this when we write.</br>
<br><b>He's</b> or <b>he's</b>??? Be careful! The 's contraction is used for the auxiliary verbs have and be. For example, "It's eaten" can mean: </br>
<li>It<b> has</b>eaten. [present perfect tense, active voice] </li>
<li>It <b>is</b> eaten. [present tense, passive voice] </li>
<br>It is usually clear from the context.</br>
