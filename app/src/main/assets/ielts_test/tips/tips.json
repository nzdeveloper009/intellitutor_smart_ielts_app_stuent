It’s best to spend 20 minutes on Task 1 to leave yourself enough time for Task 2 (remember Task 2 is worth more marks).<br><br>\n\nHere are some tips to help you with the task:<br><br>\n\nRead the question carefully and make sure you understand the graph, chart, table, diagram or map. Be clear about what you are describing.<br><br>\nWrite a short introduction by paraphrasing the question (i.e. rewrite the question in your own words).<br><br>\nBe sure to give a summary (i.e. look at the big picture – what’s happening overall. There’s no need to mention any numbers in this part.)<br><br>\nTry to use a variety of sentence structures and vocabulary.<br><br>\nSeparate your paragraphs.<br><br>\nChoose the key information to describe or compare.<br><br>\nMake comparisons where you can. Avoid simply stating what is in the question.<br><br>\nDescribe specific details. Use the numbers in the chart, table or graph to help you describe the key points.<br><br>\nDivide your main description into 2 paragraphs. This will help you to have a clear structure and organisation; especially important when <br><br>the question has two separate diagrams, tables or maps.\n<b>A couple of things to avoid:</b><br><br>\nDescribing every single detail – there are usually a lot of numbers. You don’t need to mention them all.<br><br>\nGiving reasons or sharing your opinions - the question will not ask you to do this.<br><br>\nWhat tips do you have for Task 1 of the Academic Writing paper?

        "tip_content": "There are three basic things you need to structure an IELTS Graph writing:<br><br>\n\n<b>Introduce the graph<br>\nGive an overview<br>\nGive the detail<br>\nWe’ll look at each of these in turn. <br></b><br>\n\n\n<b>1) Introduce the Graph<br><br></b>\n\nYou need to begin with one or two sentences that state what the IELTS writing task 1 shows. To do this, paraphrase the title of the graph, making sure you put in a time frame if there is one.<br><br>\n\nHere is an example for the above line graph:<br><br>\n\n<b>The line graph compares the fast food consumption of teenagers in Australia between 1975 and 2000, a period of 25 years.<br>\nYou can see this says the same thing as the title, but in a different way. <br><br></b>\n\n<b>2) Give an Overview<br><br></b>\n\nYou also need to state what the main trend or trends in the graph are. Don’t give detail such as data here – you are just looking for something that describes what is happening overall.<br><br>\n\nOne thing that stands out in this graph is that one type of fast food fell over the period, whilst the other two increased, so this would be a good overview.<br><br>\n\nHere is an example:<br><br>\n\n<b>Overall, the consumption of fish and chips declined over the period, whereas the amount of pizza and hamburgers that were eaten increased.<br>\nThis covers the main changes that took place over the whole period.<br></b>\n\nYou may sometimes see this overview as a conclusion. It does not matter if you put it in the conclusion or the introduction when you do an IELTS writing task 1, but you should provide an overview in one of these places. <br><br>\n\n\n<b>3) Give the Detail<br><br></b>\n\nYou can now give more specific detail in the body paragraphs.<br><br>\n\nWhen you give the detail in your body paragraphs in your IELTS writing task 1, you must make reference to the data.<br><br>\n\nThe key to organizing your body paragraphs for an IELTS writing task 1 is to <b>group data</b> together where there are <b>patterns</b>.<br><br>\n\nTo do this you need to identify any similarities and differences.<br><br>\n\nLook at the graph – what things are similar and what things are different?<br><br>\n\nAs we have already identified in the overview, the consumption of fish and chips declined over the period, whereas the amount of pizza and hamburgers that were eaten increased.<br><br>\n\nSo it is clear that pizza and hamburgers were following a similar pattern, but fish and chips were different. On this basis, you can use these as your ‘groups’, and focus one paragraph on fish and chip and the other one on pizza and hamburgers.<br><br>\n\nHere is an example of the first paragraph:<br><br>\n\n<b>In 1975, the most popular fast food with Australian teenagers was fish and chips, being eaten 100 times a year. This was far higher than Pizza and hamburgers, which were consumed approximately 5 times a year. However, apart from a brief rise again from 1980 to 1985, the consumption of fish and chips gradually declined over the 25 year timescale to finish at just under 40.</b><br><br>\n\nAs you can see, the focus is on fish and chips. This does not mean you should not mention the other two foods, as you should still make comparisons of the data as the questions asks.<br><br>\n\nThe second body then focuses on the other foods:<br><br>\n<b>\nIn sharp contrast to this, teenagers ate the other two fast foods at much higher levels. Pizza consumption increased gradually until it overtook the consumption of fish and chips in 1990. It then levelled off from 1995 to 2000. The biggest rise was seen in hamburgers as the occasions they were eaten increased sharply throughout the 1970’s and 1980’s, exceeding that of fish and chips in 1985. It finished at the same level that fish and chips began, with consumption at 100 times a year. </b>",

In this sample, this is the situation:<br>\n<br>\n&ensp;<b>You are going away to travel for the summer. A friend will be looking after your house while you are away. Write a letter to your friend. </b><br>\n<br>\nYou are then given three points that you must cover in the letter:<br>\n<br>\n<b>In your letter:<br>\n<br>\n&ensp;Say where you are going<br>\n&ensp;Describe your house<br>\n&ensp;Explain some of the things your friend must do to look after your house <br></b><br>\nIn order to answer the letter successfully, you need to make sure that you <b>use the right tenses</b> to fit the points.<br>\n<br>\nWe’ll break the letter now down into each of its parts to see how tenses are used. <br>\n<br>\nRemember that <b>every letter is different</b>. This lesson is just showing which tenses are needed to this particular letter. <br><br><b>First Point</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>Say where you are going:</b><br>\n<br>\n&ensp;As I mentioned to you I’m going to France for a vacation. I’ll be getting the Ferry over to northern France where I’ll spend a few days, and then I’m heading to Paris for the rest of the trip. I’ll be staying with some friends there in the city most of the time. I’ll be online and will have my phone so you can contact me any time.<br>\n<br>\nWhich tenses have been used?<br>\n<br>\nYou haven’t been to France yet. It’s something you are going to do later on, so you need to use the <b>future tense</b>. <br>\n<br>\nThe future is phrases such as:<br>\n<br>\n&ensp;Verb ‘to be’ + going to <br>\n&ensp;Verb ‘to be’ + verb + ing <br>\n&ensp;Will + infinitive .Second Point<br>\n<br>\nHere is the next part. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Describe your house:</b><br>\n<br>\n&ensp;My house is fairly small so it shouldn’t be a problem to look after it. There’s an open plan kitchen/living room downstairs and then a couple of bedrooms upstairs. You can sleep in the spare bedroom, which is at the top of the stairs on the right. There’s also a small garden which you can sit out in when it’s sunny.<br>\n<br>\nWhen we describe something, it’s common to use the <b>present simple</b>. If you look at the paragraph again you’ll see that most of it is in the present. <br>\n<br>\nOf course you’ll see other common words to describe the location of things in a place such as <b>‘There’s an……downstairs’ or “….which is at the top of the stairs”</b>.<br>\n<br>\nNow take a look at the last part:<br>\n<br>\n<b>Explain some of the things your friend must do to look after your house:</b><br>\n<br>\n&ensp;The only things I’d like you to do are to make sure you put the bins out on Tuesday night of the second week as they are collected Wednesday morning. Also, if you could water all the plants once a week it would be great. If you go out, please set the alarm as there have been burglaries in the area recently (I’ll leave you the code by the door).<br>\n<br>\nIn this last part you are giving instructions. <br>\n<br>\nWhen you give instructions, advice, or orders, you should use the imperative.

You may come up with reasons for an increase in crime such as ‘lack of parental supervision’ and ‘boredom’.<br><br>\nHowever, I have seen students come up with problems of teenage crime, such as ‘more young people being put in prison' and ‘stress for their parents'.<br><br>\nThis particular task asks you to write about ‘reasons’, not ‘problems’(though being asked to write about 'problems and solutions' is common).<br><br>\nSo if you do this you will not be answering the question. This comes from rushing and not taking enough time to identify the task properly.<br><br>\n<b>Other Question Types</b><br><br>\nThe previous question was fairly easy, so to identify the task was hopefully not too difficult.<br><br>\nSome questions, though, will take more thought in order to identify what you need to write about.<br><br>\nHere is another example:<br><br>\n<b>Advances in technology and automation have reduced the need for manual labour. Therefore, working hours should be reduced.<br>\nTo what extent do you agree?<br></b><br>\nAgain, look to the end of the prompt to identify the task.<br><br>\nYou have to say if you agree or disagree with working hours being reduced, or, in other words, automation (machines) taking over from some human’s duties.<br><br>\nYou must also say how much you agree or disagree (\"to what extent\").<br><br>\nLet’s assume you want to look at both sides of the issue. You therefore need to discuss the reasons why you agree, and the reasons why you disagree. Or put another way:<br><br>\nThe advantages of reducing working hours<br>\nThe disadvantages of reducing working hours<br><br>\nAnd of course in the introduction or conclusion you need to make it clear what your opinion is.<br><br>\nIf you do all of these things then you will have answered all parts of the prompt. If you find more reasons to agree than disagree, then you can write more about this side of the argument, or visa versa.",

        "tip_content": "One way to improve the coherency of your writing is to use <b>transition words</b> to guide the reader through what you are saying.<br><br>\n\nHere are examples of <b>common transition words</b> that will improve your writing coherence, and their meanings:<br><br>\n\nCOMMON  TRANSITION WORDS<br><br>\n\n&ensp;<b>Listing Points to Show New Ideas:</b><br><br>\n&ensp;&ensp;Firstly,   <br>\n&ensp;&ensp;First of all,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;To begin,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;Secondly,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;Finally,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;Furthermore, <br>\n&ensp;&ensp;In addition,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;Also,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;Moreover,<br><br>\n\n&ensp;<b>Showing an Example:</b><br><br>\n&ensp;&ensp;For example,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;For instance,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;To illustrate,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;A case in point,<br><br>\n\n&ensp;<b>Showing Contrast:</b><br><br>\n&ensp;&ensp;However, <br>\n&ensp;&ensp;On the other hand,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;In contrast,                             <br><br>\n\n&ensp;<b>Showing a Result:</b><br><br>\n&ensp;&ensp;Therefore,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;As a result,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;Consequently,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;Thus,                             <br><br>\n&ensp;<b>Showing time:</b> (commonly in essay introductions)<br><br>\n&ensp;&ensp;These days,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;Nowadays,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;At present,                             <br><br>\n&ensp;<b>To introduce concluding comments:</b><br><br>\n&ensp;&ensp;To conclude,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;In conclusion,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;In brief,<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;All in all,,    <br><br>\n\n<b>How to use the words in sentences</b><br><br>\n\nAs you now know, transition words are used to guide a reader through your writing and to make it more coherent. The better your writing coherence, the easier it will be to follow your arguments in your essay. <br><br>\nOne important point though before we go on. If you <b>over use transitions</b> they can make your writing look slightly <b>mechanical</b> as very good writers will need to use them less as they will have the ability to cleverly guide someone through their writing without them.<br><br>\n\nIt is quite a high level skill though. So it really depends on your ability. If you are at a lower level of writing, you should make more use of them as they will make it easy for the examiner to follow your ideas.<br><br>\n\nIf you have more sophistication in your writing, you may not want to use them too much or it could affect your style.<br><br>\nIf you are unsure, it probably means you need to be using them! We'll now go on to look further at how some of them are used.<br><br>\nMost of these transition words are used in the same way in sentences and are followed by a subject and verb.<br><br>\n<b>Varying Position and Use of Transition Words</b><br><br>\nHowever, you do not want to use these words too ‘mechanically’ so you should vary their position, and don’t repeat the same word too often. You can vary the position with the following transitions:<br><br>\n <br>\n<b>1) Giving Examples</b><br><br>\nYou can vary your use of ‘for example’ and ‘for instance’ by moving them to after the first phrase of the sentence or to after the subject or verb.<br><br>\n<b>\n&ensp;There are many ways to improve congestion.  Some cities in The Netherlands, for instance, have pedestrian only city centres.<br><br>\n&ensp;There are many ways to improve congestion.  Some cities in The Netherlands have, for instance, pedestrian only city centres.<br></b><br>\n<b>2) Giving a Contrast or Result</b><br><br>\n\nSimilarly, you can place contrast or result transitions further down the sentence:<br>\n\n&ensp;Tokyo now has a Sky Train.  Traffic problems, as a result/therefore/as a consequence, have decreased significantly.<br>\n<br>\n&ensp;These can also be joined to the previous sentence with the conjunction 'and’:<br><br>\n&ensp;Tokyo now has a Sky Train, and, as a result/therefore/as a consequence, traffic problems have decreased significantly.<br>\n<br>\nNote: you cannot join it to another sentence without ’and’:<br><br>\n&ensp;Tokyo now has a Sky Train, as a result, traffic problems  have decreased significantly.  - this is incorrect.<br>\n <br>\n3) <b>Listing Points</b><br>\nThese can also be varied.  For example:<br><br>\n&ensp;Firstly, an advantage of a new public transport system is that it will reduce traffic congestion.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, to improve your writing, you should vary the way you use these.  They can be changed so they are no longer a transition but become part of the subject:<br>\n&ensp;The first advantage of a new public transport system is that it will reduce traffic congestion.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis lesson has shown how you can use transitions to improve your writing coherence.<br>\nMake sure you find out more about these transitions so you know how to use them correctly, then practice using them in your writing.<br>",

You need a good IELTS essay introduction, but one thing you do not want to do is spend too long writing it so that you end up rushing your paragraphs.<br>\n<br>\nYour <b>paragraphs</b> are the <b>most important thing</b> as they contain all your supporting arguments and demonstrate how good you are at organizing your ideas.<br>\n<br>\nYou therefore need a method to write your IELTS essay introduction fairly quickly. When you write an introduction, you should make sure you do two things:<br>\n<br>\n&ensp;Write a sentence introducing the topic and giving some background facts about it <br>\n<br>\n&ensp;Tell the reader what you are going to be writing about<br><br>\n\nHow you do this will vary depending on the question, but here is an example:<br>\n<br>\n<b>Example 1:</b><br><br>\nQuestion:<br><br>\n\nBlood sports have become a hot topic for debate in recent years. As society develops it is increasingly seen as an uncivilized activity and cruel to the helpless animals that are killed.

I believe that blood sports are cruel and uncivilized and so should be banned as soon as possible.<br><br>\n\nAs you can see, the <b>first sentence</b> consists of the topic plus somebackground facts on the topic which have been taken from the rubric.<br><br>\n\nThe second sentence then gives the writers opinion and tells us that in the essay the writer will be arguing the reasons why it is cruel.<br>\nThe topic does not have to be in the first sentence, but it should be made clear somewhere in the introduction. You must always have a thesis.<br>\n<br>\n\n<b>Paraphrasing</b><br><br>\n\nAnother important point - <b>don't copy from the question!</b> You must paraphrase (put it in your own words). To do this you can use synonyms and move the order of the sentence around.<br><br>\n\nUsing some of the same words is acceptable, but <b>don't copy whole phrases.</b><br><br>\n\nYou can see how the question above has been paraphrased. All the information is from the question, but it has been written in a different way and has not been copied.",

        "tip_content": "<b>The Marking Criteria</b><br>\n<br>\nTo explain this, we'll begin by looking at the <b>IELTS band descriptors</b> for a band 7.<br><br>\n\nThis is not a secret. This information is taken from the IELTS public band descriptors and is freely available from a test centre or you will find it if you search on the internet.<br>\n<br>\nYou are given a band score for each of the criteria, and the ones in this table in the descriptors column are those that are specifically needed for an IELTS band 7.<br>\n<br>\n\n<b>Task Achievement:</b><br>\n<br>\nAddresses all parts of the task<br>\nPresents a clear position throughout the response<br>\nPresents, extends and supports main ideas, but there may be a tendency to over-generalize and/or supporting ideas may lack focus<br>\n<br>\n<b>Coherence & Cohesion:</b><br><br>\n\n&ensp;Logically organizes information and ideas; there is a clear progression throughout<br>\n&ensp;Uses a range of cohesive devices appropriately although there may be some under-/over-use<br>\n&ensp;Presents a clear central topic within each paragraph<br>\n<br>\n\n<b>Lexical Resource:</b><br><br>\n\nUses a sufficient range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility and precision<br>\nUses less common lexical items with some awareness of style and collocation<br>\nMay produce occasional errors in word choice, spelling, and/or word formation<br>\n<br>\n\n<b>Grammatical Range and Accuracy:</b><br><br>\n\n&ensp;Uses a variety of complex structures<br>\n&ensp;Produces frequent error-free sentences<br>\n&ensp;Has good control of grammar and punctuation but may make a few errors<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe'll now just have a look at each of them in a bit more detail to highlight some common areas where you may possibly be going wrong.<br><br>\n\n\n<b>Task Achievement</b><br>\n<br>\nVery bascially, this is an assessment of whether you have <b>fully answered the question</b> and provided <b>good support for your ideas.</b><br><br>\n\nTo address all parts of the task, you must <b>respond to everything that is asked in the question.</b><br><br>\n\nTo take an example, look at this question:<br><br>\n\n<b>Some people think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others, however, believe there are better alternative ways of reducing crime.<br>\n<br>\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.</b><br><br>\n\n\nThe task is to discuss both the opinions and to give your opinion.<br><br>\n\nSo, for example, if you only wrote about one of the opinions or did not give your opinion, you will not have addressed all parts of the question so you can't get an IELTS band 7 for task achievement.<br><br>\n\nOr if you only wrote a small amount on one of the opinions, this may not be seen as fully answering the question either.<br><br>\n\nThere is a lesson here that explains the importance of identifying the task to make sure you fully answer all parts of the question.<br><br>\n\nYou must also have a <b>clear position throughout</b>. So if your opinion is not clear and you seem to change it during the essay, then this could be a problem for achieving an IELTS band 7 in this criterion.<br><br>\n\nYou also need to <b>fully extend and support your ideas</b>. So it is not enough just to put lots of ideas down - fewer ideas are better that are explained properly with reasons and examples.<br><br>\n\nLook at some model essays to see how a clear position is presented throughout and how only a few ideas are presented but they are fully explained and supported.<br>\n<br>\n\n<b>Coherence and Cohesion</b><br><br>\n\nVery basically, this is how you <b>organize and present your ideas</b>, and how <b>easy your work is to read</b>.<br><br>\n\nSo you will need to know how to organize an essay properly in terms of paragraphing and having ideas that logically and clearly go from one to the next to get an IELTS band 7.<br><br>\n\nAnother key point here is that you have to have a <b>clear central topic within each paragraph</b>.<br><br>\n\nTo take a simple example, if you are writing about the advantages and disadvantages of something, then you may want to have one paragraph about each. Each paragraph will then have a clear central topic - either advantages or disadvantages.<br><br>\n\nIf you mix them up, this may not be clear.<br><br>\n\nAgain, look at some of the model essays to see how each body paragraph clearly has one central topic.<br><br>\n\nYou also need a mix of cohesive devices. These are the things that join and link your ideas, sentences and paragraphs. For example,transitions such as 'however', 'firstly', 'moreover', and other general linking words within sentences such as 'and' and 'because'.<br>\n\n<br>You will need a variety and mix of these for an IELTS band 7, and you'll need to be able to use them effectively with some flexibilityrather than mechanically.<br>\n<br>\n\n<b>Lexical Resource</b><br><br>\n\nYour lexis is basically your <b>vocabulary</b>, and as it says in the descriptors, you'll need to show that you know some <b>less common words</b> and be able to use them precisely.<br>\n\nIts in the accuracy that is needed for your vocabulary that problems can often occur with regards to getting an IELTS band 7.<br><br>\n\nAs you can see, you can only make occasional errors in your word choice, word formation and spelling. This means the majority need to be correct!<br><br>\n\nThis is obviously no easy achievement and so you'll need to be a fairly skilled writer to be making only occasional errors with your lexis.<br><br>\n\nYou can find some useful and less common vocabulary by following this link, but you need to learn how to use the words correctly otherwise you may make more mistakes with word forms.<br><br>\n\nUsing lots of new words that you don't know how to use properly could make your writing worse, so be careful! Only use words you know how to use properly.<br>\n<br>\n\n<b>Grammatical Range and Accuracy</b><br><br>\n\nAs will be clear from the title, this one is assessing your level of grammar.<br><br>\n\nYou will need to show you can use a wide range of sentence structures and have a high level of accuracy.<br><br>\n\nJust having a few complex sentences with words such as 'because', 'if' and 'although' may not be enough. You'll need to have an awareness of some more complex structures.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, like the lexis, this can often be where students struggle to get an IELTS band 7. You need to have frequent error-free sentences.<br>\n<br>\nIn other words, the majority of your sentences can't have grammar errors. This is not easy, so like with the lexis, you will need to be a fairly skilled writer.<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<b>Some final tips...</b><br><br>\n\nThis lesson then has shown you how to get an IELTS band 7 in your writing, or what is required.<br><br>\n\nUnfortunately there is no magic bullet that is suddenly going to move you up a band. But there may be things you can improve on that will help if you think you are making errors in what what is needed in the criteria.<br><br>\n\nFor example, are you always spending some time at the beginning <b>analyzing the question</b> carefully to make sure you are answering all parts of it and <b>writing a plan / outline?</b><br>\n<br>\nIf not, you may be making errors by not fully answering the question or by not organizing your essay or ideas well.<br>\n<br>\nMost of my students that I check are failing to get the majority of the sentences error-free or the majority of the lexis correct. So this may well be where you are falling down if you are getting a 6.5.<br>\n<br>\nIn this case you'll need to work on <b>improving your grammar</b> andchecking your work very carefully for mistakes. If you have a writing teacher obviously this will help as they can check your work.<br>\n<br>\nBut again, <b>planning first can help</b> with this because if you plan then you will be able to write quicker. You will then have more time to be more careful and more time to check your grammar and lexis whilst you write and at the end.",

        "tip_content": "This lesson will give you the basic tips on paragraph writing.<br><br>\n\nYou should follow the same structure that you would for writing any paragraph when you write an IELTS paragraph, though it may be shorter because of the limited time that you have.<br><br>\n\nThis limited time and space means that you have to get your ideas across as clearly and succinctly as possible.<br>\n<br>\nIf you have planned well before you write, then you should be well on your way to being able to write your paragraphs quickly and clearly.<br>\n<br>\nThe following has all the components of a good paragraph. <br>\n<br>\nRead it through and identify why this is.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Studying Abroad</b><br>\n<br>\nStudying abroad has two main benefits.  Firstly, people who study abroad can get a better job when they return to their home country.  This is because their qualifications and experience mean that they tend to get jobs that are higher paid, and they can also gain promotion quickly. Another advantage of studying abroad is the independence students can gain. For example, students have to cope with the challenges of living alone and meeting new people from different cultures.  As a consequence, they will become more confident in their life and in their relationships with others.  All in all, it is clear that studying abroad is a beneficial experience.<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<b>The Three Parts to Good Paragraph Writing</b><br><br>\n\nThe 'text book' structure for a paragraph is as follows:<br><br>\n\n&ensp;Topic sentence<br>\n&ensp;Supporting sentences<br>\n&ensp;Concluding sentence<br><br>\n\n<b>1. Topic Sentence</b><br><br>\n\nThe <b>topic sentence</b> states what the paragraph will be about.  It gives the topic of the paragraph, and it also restricts the topic to one or two main ideas which can be explained fully in the space of one paragraph.  The controlling idea is the specific area that the topic is limited to:<br><br>\n\ntopic         <->         controlling idea<br><br>\n\nStudying abroad has two main benefits<br><br>\n\n<b>2. Supporting Sentences</b><br><br>\n\n<b>Supporting sentences</b> explain and develop the topic sentence.  Specifically, they discuss the topic sentence by explaining the main ideas and discussing those more fully using reasons, examples, facts, results, statistics, or anything else that proves your ideas are true. <br><br>\n\nThe supporting sentences that explain the benefits of studying abroad are:<br><br>\n\nPeople get a better job when they return home (1st supporting idea)<br><br>\n\nBetter qualifications & experience mean better pay and promotion (reason)<br>\nNow has a high standard of living (result)<br><br>\n\nStudents gain independence (2nd supporting idea)<br><br>\n\nStudents have to cope with the challenges of living alone and meeting new people from different cultures.(example)<br>\nStudents will become more confident in their life and relationships (result)<br><br>\n\n<b>3. Concluding Sentence (Optional)</b><br><br>\n\nA concluding sentence can be used to signal the end of the paragraph. It tells the reader the important points to remember.  It is often a paraphrase of the topic sentence.<br><br>\n\n&ensp;&ensp;All in all, it is clear that studying abroad is a beneficial experience.<br><br>\n\nConcluding sentences are optional and paragraphs often do not have them.  You won't get marked down if you do not have a concluding sentence in IELTS, but it is a good way to add coherence to your paragraph.<br>\n<br>\n\n<b>Unity and Coherence</b><br><br>\n\nFor good paragraph writing, there must also be unity and coherence. The examiner will assess your IELTS paragraphs on their unity and coherence, which is clearly shown in the IELTS public band descriptors under \"Coherence and Cohesion\" for what is required for a band 7:<br><br>\n\n&ensp;&ensp;logically organises information and ideas; there is clear progression throughout<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;uses a range of cohesive devices appropriately<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;presents a clear central topic within each paragraph<br><br>\n\n<b>1. Unity</b><br><br>\n\nUnity means that you discuss only one main (central) topic area in a paragraph.  The area that you are going to cover is usually introduced in the topic sentence, and your supporting sentences should only be used to develop that. <br><br>\n\nFor the topic sentence above, you could discuss only two benefits of studying abroad.  You could not discuss three benefits, or start discussing the disadvantages of studying abroad.  If you did, your paragraph would not have unity.<br><br>\n\nEven if there is no specific topic sentence (more advanced writers do not always have an obvious topic sentence), the paragraph should still have one central topic area so it retains unity.<br><br>\n\n<b>2. Coherence</b><br><br>\n\nAnother element of good paragraph writing is coherency. This means your paragraph is easy to understand and read because<br>\n(a) The supporting sentences are arranged in a logical order and  <br>\n(b) The ideas are joined by appropriate transition signals.<br><br>\n\n(a) Logical Order<br><br>\n\nFor example, in the paragraph about studying abroad, there are two main ideas: People who study abroad can get a better job, and they will become more independent.   Each of these ideas is discussed, one after the other, with examples, reasons and results to support them.  This is logical order.<br><br>\n\n(b) Transition Signals<br><br>\n\nFurthermore, the relationship between the ideas is clearly shown by using appropriate transition words and phrases such as first of all, for instance, the result of this, another advantage,  as a consequence, all in all.    Using such words and phrases will guide the reader through your paragraph, making it coherent and, therefore, easy to understand.",

        "tip_content": "<b>IELTS opinion essays</b> are very common in the exam.<br><br>\n\nIt can be a bit confusing, especially if you are new to IELTS, to work out the different types of essay.<br><br>\n\nSome people talk about <b>'argumentative essays', 'thesis-led essays', 'discussion essays'</b>, which can get quite confusing and it is usually not necessary to know this.<br><br>\n\nThe important thing is to <b>analyze each question</b> as you see it andanswer it.<br><br>\n\nThe aim of this lesson is to give you a brief overview of the <b>common types of essay that ask for your opinion</b>.<br><br>\n\nOf course not everything will fit this pattern as there are a variety of ways a question can be worded, but the types below are common ways to be asked about your opinion in the test.<br>\n<br>\n\nTask 2 IELTS Opinion Essays can broadly be put into three types:<br><br>\n\n<b>1. Discuss ONE opinion</b><br><br>\n\nAdvances in technology and automation have reduced the need for manual labour. (opinion)Therefore, working hours should be reduced.<br>\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?<br><br>\n\nWith these essays you are normally given ONE opinion, and then asked specifically if you agree or disagree with it, or to what extent you agree or disagree. You must make it clear whether you agree, disagree or partly agree and give your reasons why.<br>\n<br>\n<b><b>2. Discuss TWO OPPOSING opinions</b></b><br><br>\n\n&ensp;(opinion one) A growing number of people feel that animals should not be exploited by people and that they should have the same rights as humans,(opposing opinion) while others argue that humans must employ animals to satisfy their various needs, including uses for food and research.<br>\n<br>\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.<br>\n<br>\nWith these essays you have TWO opinions that oppose each other. You have to discuss BOTH of them and also give your opinion. Your essay will get a lower mark for 'task response' if you don’t discuss both of the opinions or you don’t make your opinion clear.<br>\n<br>\n<b>3. Advantages and Disadvantages</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>The number of old people around the world is increasing dramatically.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCould this have more positive or negative effects on society? or…<br>\n<br>\nDo the advantages of the trend outweigh the disadvantages? or…<br>\n<br>\nIs this a positive development?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nIn these questions you are given a fact or facts and then you have to look at the positive and negative sides of this. They are all asking for your opinion so you must state this. In the first two you will need to look at both sides as the question is clearly implying there are both positive and negative impacts.<br>\nDon't mix this up with a basic advantage and disadvantage essay like this:<br><br>\n<b>What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?</b><br><br>\nAlthough your organization, ideas and body paragraphs may be similar, this one is not asking for your opinion so you don't need to give it. It is simply asking you to present both sides of the issue.",

Most Task 2 questions will ask you to discuss or analyse an issue in terms of advantages/disadvantages and/or take a position by agreeing or disagreeing. This means you can almost always use a four paragraph structure, for example:<br><br>\n\nAdvantages/disadvantages question <br>\n- Introduction: paraphrase the question and give a general answer <br>\nthat will summarise your opinion <br>\n- Main paragraph 1: what are the advantages <br>\n- Main paragraph 2: what are the disadvantages <br>\n- Conclusion: paraphrase your argument and highlight or restate your personal opinion or position on the issue.<br><br>\n\nAgree / disagree question <br>\n- Introduction: paraphrase the question and give a general answer <br>\nthat will summarise your opinion <br>\n- Main paragraph 1: I agree/disagree because … + supporting reasons <br>\n- Main paragraph 2: Another reason I agree / disagree is … \n- Conclusion: paraphrase your argument and sum up.<br><br>\n\nMake sure you note down examples and supporting details for each paragraph. Your arguments should also clearly link back to the position you stated in the introduction.<br><br>\n\nSpend some time thinking of good vocabulary related to your topic. Note it down.<br><br>\nWriting<br><br>\n\nStart each paragraph with a topic sentence i.e. the general topic of the paragraph.<br><br>\n\nDevelop your ideas in each paragraph by giving reasons for your answer and include examples from your own knowledge or experience.<br><br>\n\nKeep your examples fairly short. Don’t go into too much detail; make sure you stay on topic.<br><br>\n\nTry using linking words like ‘firstly, secondly, finally’ to connect your ideas within each of your main paragraphs. This will help your writing to flow.",

        "tip_content": "This time the focus is on vocabulary. There is no magic bullet here – vocabulary learning takes time. That’s the bad news. What I do do though is to talk you through some of the more common problems with vocabulary in essays and give you some tips on avoiding them.<br><br>\n\nRead through this sample essay. It is well structured and addresses the question, but it is weak on vocab. Can you see what the problems are?<br><br>\n<i>\nWe live in a world where health and safety is more and more important One of the signs of this is the demand that dangerous sports should be banned. While I understand that argument, my view is that people should be free to do whatever sports they want.<br><br>\n\nThe biggest reason for objecting to extreme sports is that they can be very dangerous and can sometimes kill people. More than that, it is not just the sportspeople who are in danger, but spectators too can be badly injured. If, for example, a Formula 1 car crashes, the driver may be hurt and it is possible that people in the crowd will be too. Because of this danger, it is understandable why people want the government to ban these sports.<br><br>\n\nThe opposite argument is that people should be free to do whatever risk they want. So, if someone wants to jump out of a plane, then they should be allowed to and the government cannot say what they should do. Many dangerous sports are also not very risky and it is as dangerous doing everyday activities such as crossing the road or cooking a meal than bungee jumping.<br><br>\n\nI think that the government should regulate dangerous sports, but it should not ban them. It should also make certain that there is as little danger as possible because safety is the most important thing. This is most important for young children.</i><br><br>\n\n<b>Seeing the problems – unnecessary repetition</b><br><br>\n\nOne of the most common problems is you can get “stuck” on certain words. This frequently happens with words in the question itself. You will see my improved version retains has some repetition – there is less of it.<br><br>\n\nDon’t be afraid to repeat some words/phrases as that is good for the cohesion and coherence of your writing.<br><br>\n\n<b>Tip – think of vocabulary before you start writing</b><br><br>\n\nThe idea is quite simple. If you think of the words you want to use before you write, then you can use them. On the other hand, if you start writing too quickly, then it becomes much harder to try and vary your vocab.<br><br>\n\n<b>Tip – repetition should be on everyone’s editing checklist</b><br><br>\n\nOne of my top tips is that everyone should have a mental checklist of the type of errors they look for when they check their work – “I’m going to look for any mistake” doesn’t really work. The point here is that even the best writers can subconsciously get stuck on words and keep on repeating them if they are not careful.<br><br>\n\n<b>Tip – if you can’t find another word, repeat it in a different form</b><br><br>\n\nSometimes there is only one correct word. In this case, the best advice is not to find another word that may well be wrong, but to change the word slightly. This can mean using the noun form and not the verb form (ban becomes impose a ban on) or to qualify it with another word so ban becomes ban entirely.<br><br>\n\n<b>Tip – when you learn vocabulary, learn phrases and not just words</b><br><br>\n\nPart of solution to this problem is to learn phrases. For example, you are much more likely to be able to use “participate”, if you have first learnt the phrase “participate in a sport”.<br><br>\n\n<b>Finding solutions – think examples for precise language</b><br><br>\n\nThis is one of my favourite suggestions. The idea is that if you learn to use examples well, you get to use language that is precise and sometimes relatively simple. Take a look at this revised versions of the examples. the revisions may seem quite small, but I get to use precise language – a good thing.<br><br>\n\n<i>The counter argument is that people should be allowed to assume whatever risk they choose. So, if someone wishes to freefall from a plane at 30,000 feet, then they should be free to do so and it should be accepted that it is not the place of the government to dictate how they lead their lives. A further point is that in statistical terms there is a low probability of injury in many so-called dangerous sports and people are at greater risk carrying out everyday activities such as crossing the road or cooking a meal as bungee jumping.<br><br>\n\nThe principal reason for objecting to extreme sports is of course that they can be highly dangerous and sometimes life-threatening. More than that, it is not just the participants who are at risk, but spectators too can be seriously injured. If, for example, a Formula 1 car crashes, the driver may not escape unharmed and there is also a chance that a bouncing tyre or debris will fly into the crowd. Given this level of danger, it is understandable why people call for the authorities to take action.</i>",

Don’t use shorthand: “Men went up.” “Women went down.” Instead, write about the real data: “The number of men at university fell dramatically,” “The percentage of female students getting a degree rose suddenly.”<br><br>\n\nDon’t use “I feel”, “as I have written,” “as you can see,” etc. Keep it academic. In IELTS, you can give your opinions in Task 2.

        "tip_content": "<b>Stage 1 – read and understand the question</b><br><br>\n\nMany “good’ essays go wrong simply because they don’t answer the question that is being asked. All IELTS essay questions have a precise question that needs to be answered. If you fail to give time to reading and understanding the question, you are most unlikely to answer it well. A possible problem here is that some candidates may come from an academic background where it is enough to write about the general topic within the question. That doesn’t work in IELTS. To avoid this common mistake simply make giving enough time to read and understand the question part of your writing routine.<br><br><br>\n\nCommon mistakes<br><br>\n\nYou get an essay topic, you have written before. You write the same answer. The question is different.<br>\nYou write about a general topic, not the question itself.<br>\nYou simply misunderstand what the question is asking you to do.<br><br>\n<b>Stage 2 – think – don’t just plan, really think</b><br><br>\n\nI could call this stage in the process “Plan”. Here I prefer the word “Think”. The danger with plans are that they may be ready-made and they may not fit the question in front of you. I prefer the word “Think” because it is more likely to get you looking at the question in front of you and deciding how you can answer it using your language, knowledge and experience at that moment. Part of the point is that you should treat each different essay as a new essay. You can borrow structures/ideas/language from essays you have written in the past, but you need to make certain they apply to the question in front of you. That means thinking: thinking not just about what to include but what not to include. Your ideas must link together to form a whole – that requires more thought.<br><br><br>\n\nCommon mistakes<br><br>\n\nThe ideas and examples are fine, they don’t relate to the question as it is asked<br>\nYou start writing and then half way through you realise that your essay doesn’t make sense – it’s too late to start over<br><br>\n \n\nThe writing process<br><br>\n\nI think it can help to divide the writing process into 3 to reflect the 3 parts of your essay. Each part of your essay does a different job to do, so why not treat each part of the essay as a different stage in the process?\n\n<b>Stage 3 – write an introduction – look both backwards and forwards</b>\n\nThe intro matters for various reasons. Not the least of these is that it is the first thing the examiner reads. Get it wrong and you have made an immediate bad impression. That’s not good. Another point to focus on in this part of the process is that the intro is the link between the question and your answer. In this stage of the process, I suggest you need to ensure that you are looking back at the question (to make sure that you are writing about the right thing) and forwards towards your answer (that anyone reading knows what you are talking about).<br><br>\n\nCommon problem to be avoided<br><br>\n\nYou don’t identify the question correctly<br>\nIt’s not clear what your position to the question is<br><br>\n<b>Stage 4 – develop your ideas in the main body – be clear about what you think and explain it</b><br><br>\n\nTo me, this stage of the process is slightly different and it requires you to think in a different way. The idea is that you don’t just need to give an answer to the question: the answer needs to be coherent. This largely means two things. Firstly, you need to make sure that your ideas are clear – one main idea per paragraph. You also need to be able to explain those ideas and show why/how they relate to the question.<br><br>\n\nCommon problems<br><br>\n\nThere’s too much detail and it isn’t clear what the main idea is<br>\nThe ideas aren’t supported with reasons and examples<br>\nThe ideas are good but they don’t relate to the question<br><br>\n<b>Stage 5 – summarise the ideas in your conclusion – make sure your essay is a whole</b><br><br>\n\nNo essay would be complete without a conclusion of course. The writing skill is slightly different here too. I would suggest that it is different because it is a reading then writing skill – you can’t very well write a conclusion until/unless you have read your essay. This is because your conclusion makes your essay complete by going back to the introduction and reflecting the question there and also looking back to the main body and picking out your main points there. It’sa different writing skill because you are trying to say as much as possible in only a few words – that is what a summary is!<br><br>\n\nCommon mistakes<br><br>\n\nsometimes the conclusion doesn’t get written – that means you haven’t written an essay<br>\nsometimes the conclusion doesn’t match the content of the essay – or, even worse, it doesn’t answer the question<br><br>\n<b>Stage 6 – go over what you wrote</b><br><br>\n\nThe reality of exam essays is that you only have one chance to get it right. You don’t have time to write it once and then improve it – as you would with a piece of real academic writing. That said, it is important to check what you write. My personal suggestion is that this stage of the process gets repeated during the entire writing stage – do not leave it to the end. That’s almost certainly too late.\n\n<b>A practice exercise – you can learn more from rewriting an old essay than writing a new essay</b><br><br>\n\nThis is boring perhaps but it is a real learning exercise. Find an essay you have already written. Write it again. The idea is not so much to correct mistakes in your old essay, it’s to be aware of the process of writing. It works to take an old essay because you already have ideas and words for it. You don’t have to worry so much about content (the what) more about the process (the how).\n\nConcentrate on each phase of the process – ask yourself the question “what I am trying to do now?”<br>\nDon’t worry about timing too much – it may even make sense to have a cup of tea between each stage",

        "tip_content": "The main body of your essay is the most important part and requires the most thought. In this lesson I give you some checklists of things to think about as you write, or before you write, the main paras. It is good to focus on what you are trying to do before you write,but there is a danger that you will “confuse yourself” if you try and think of too many things. If so, remember just this: your writing score is<br><br>\n\n25% Task response<br>\n25% Coherence and Cohesion<br>\n25% Vocabulary<br>\n25% Grammar<br><br>\n\nIf you are well prepared, then that may be enough information. I would emphasise, however,  that it still pays to <b>stop before you write each paragraph and ask yourself how you will answer the task, be coherent and cohesive, use a range of vocab and write accurately. </b> You might even do this before each sentence!<br><br>\n\n<b>Coherence – linking your thoughts</b><br><br>\n\nCoherence is how well your ideas link together and is the skill of making sense – it is something you should focus on as you write. In essays, it works at two levels and as you write you need to think about both of these:<br><br>\n\nDo the paragraphs link together so that my essay makes sense.? This is a question of essay structure.<br>\nDo the sentences in the paragraphs link together so that the paragraphs make sense? This is a question of paragraph structure.<br><br>\n<b>Essay structure is coherence – decide on the role of paragraphs</b><br><br>\n\nNearly all IELTS essays follow a simple structure. There are either going to be 4 or 5 paragraphs in all with 2 or 3 body paragraphs. These paragraphs will generally do one of 3 things: support each other by making the same point in a different way, say something that takes the opposite point of view or make a separate point altogether. This means that in the exam you have to answer 2 questions:<br><br>\n\nHow many paragraphs am I going to write?<br>\nWill those paragraphs support each other, take opposite views or make separate points<br><br>\nMy best suggestion when you think about the essay structure  is that you <b>don’t worry about the type of essay you are writing: Opinion/Argument etc. You just answer those 2 questions.</b>  This is a simpler approach and there is always more than one way to answer a question. All you need to worry about is whether your approach is logical and answers the question in front of you.<br><br>\n\n<b>Essay structure is topic sentences too –  identify the main points in your first/topic sentences</b><br><br>\n\nIf you have planned well, you should already know your essay structure – particularly if you have drawn an essay map. All the same I do think it is wise to refocus on this as you begin each content paragraph. The goal is to make sure that what you are about to write does link back to the introduction. In practical terms, this means that you make sure that<b> the first sentence in each paragraph clearly states what that paragraph is about</b> and that idea is found in the introduction – these are the famous “topic sentences”.<br><br>\n\nTop tip: Keep your topic sentences simple and to the point.Their function is not to say anything clever,just to say where you are in your argument.<br><br>\n\n<b>Paragraph structure is coherence</b><br><br>\n\nYou also need to focus on making sure your paragraphs make sense. Again,this is where a good plan really can help. In practical terms, my suggestion here is that before you write each paragraph you should know how that paragraph finishes. If you write “dynamically” and simply keep on adding ideas, then there is every chance the ideas may not work together – no matter how good they are. Here is a quick checklist for you to look at before you write:<br><br>\n\nDo I know the one main idea of the paragraph?<br>\nDo I know the structure of the paragraph?Am I going to list or explain one point more fully?<br>\nAm I clear about what is the main idea,what is a supporting reason and what is an example?<br>\nDo the reasons and examples support the main idea?<br><br>\n<b>Cohesion – linking your words</b><br><br>\n\nThis is the twin of coherence – it is linking as well, but this time linking words rather than ideas. You will probably learn most about the skills of cohesion before the exam. That does not mean that you should forget it in the exam itself. Here are 2 practical things to think about that may help you write better:<br><br>\n\nconsider beginning each sentence with a linking idea – this need not be a word like “Furthermore”,often a pronoun like “This”works just as well<br>\nconsider using synonyms and words of the same family to link your writing – this is a very practical idea because it will also help your vocabulary<br><br>\n<b>Grammar and Vocabulary</b><br><br>\n\nOh yes, these matter too! You should of course make sure that you make as few mistakes as possible. It can though sometimes be a problem if you focus too hard on these as you write -particularly at lower levels if you worry about these too much either the essay doesn’t get finished or it isn’t coherent . Here are a few thoughts for you that may be practical in the exam:<br><br>\n\nknow how you will finish a sentence before you start it – a lot of mistakes are caused by starting- stopping – starting again. The first bit is ok. So is the second bit. They just don’t work together.<br><br>\n\ngood vocab tends to be precise vocab – precise vocab tends to come from examples<br><br>\n\nsome of the best grammar you can use comes from qualifying your ideas (modals, relatives and if clauses)- so if you want to use better grammar think about not having too many general statements, but using one statement that you explain in different ways\n<br><br>\n\nYou might note that there is a strong connection between these ideas and coherence, which is part of the reason why I started this lesson talking about it. If you want to focus on just one thing as you write your content paras, for many people coherence may be the best answer",
