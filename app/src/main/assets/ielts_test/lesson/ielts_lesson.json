Some candidates think they have to sound very formal and academic.</p>\n<p>You obviously do need some good vocabulary to get a higher score on the test, such as that from the academic word list (used correctly of course!), but language that you would hear naturally if you had a conversation with your friends is also as important and will get noticed by the examiner.</p>\n<p>Take a look at this question and then the answer by a candidate:</p> <p>When do you think it is acceptable to be late for appointments?</p> <p>You should always try to be on time. (However), there are some occasions when it is ok to be late.</p> <p>(Firstly), in my country the traffic is terrible, so sometimes you cannot help but be late because of that.

(Moreover), if an emergency arises because of, for example, a problem with your child, you will need to take care of that first of course.</p> <p>The problem with this response is the words linking the ideas, or the transitions. It is not that they are 'wrong' as such. In theory they can be used as the meaning is clear, but they are very formal.</p> <p>They are suitable for an academic essay, but you will not often hear someone use these words when they are speaking with you.</p>\n<p>So if you use these it will make what you say sound very forced and unnatural.</p> <p>Here is the same answer but the speaking tone is more (natural):</p> <p>When do you think it is acceptable to be late for appointments?</p> <p>You should always try to be on time, (but having said that), there are some occasions when it is ok to be late.(A particular problem in my country) is the terrible traffic jams, so sometimes you cannot help but be late because of that. (Also), if you are very ill for an unexpected reason, again there is nothing you can do about that. (Another good reason is) if an emergency arises because of, for example, a problem with your child, you will need to take care of that first of course.</p> <p>  </p>\n<p>As you can see, this sounds more natural and will sound more fluent.

So you have to listen carefully.</p> <p>Take a look at this example question:</p> <p>IELTS Examiner: How important do you think it is to learn English language?</p>\n<p>Candidate: Oh, I really like learning English. I think it will really help with my career.</p>\n<p>This candidate has shown that they did not listen properly, or simply misunderstood the question.</p> <p>These are the kinds of answers that would be expected.</p> <p>It's very important because...</p>\n<p>It's extremely important...</p>\n<p>It's fairly important because..</p>\n<p>It's quite important because...</p>\n<p>I don't think it's very important because...</p>\n<p>So in this case it is an adverb of degree that would be expected as they commonly follow how questions that ask for an opinion about something.</p> <p>That is not to say that there are not other possibilities, but this directly answers the question, unlike the other reponse which was incorrect.</p> <p>Now try this speaking questions for IELTS exercise to see if you know the meaning of other common question phrases.</p> <p>Link the question phrase to its correct meaning.</p> <p>Of course you have to be careful how you answer each question.</p> <p>There can be many different types of question using these phrases and many different answers, but below are some examples on the topic of food based on part 1 of the test.</p> <p>Note how the answers, though, to these speaking questions for IELTS directly relate to the question.</p> <p>Also, notice how the answers are extended by giving reasons, which is important for part 1.</p> <p>  </p> <p>Examples of Types of Speaking Questions for IELTS</p> <p>Food</p> <p>How important is having breakfast to you?</p> <p>Not very important really. I often miss it as I never feel that hungry when I first wake up. Lunch is often the first meal of the day for me.</p> <p>Would you rather eat out or eat at home?</p> <p>I prefer to eat in as I like home cooked food. You know for sure what is in the ingredients, whereas at a restaurant you can never be sure of what is in the food and whether it is healthy or not.</p> <p>How often do you eat out?</p> <p>About once or twice a week. Mostly I eat in because I get back from work late and don't have time to get to a restaurant.</p> <p>What kind of restaurants do you like to go to if you do eat out?</p> <p>Usually it is small family run places. They have a better atmosphere than those big chains and often the price if more reasonable too. You can also get to know the owner which is nice.</p> <p>When did you last go to a restaurant?</p> <p>Oh, it was probably about a week ago, last weekend. I went to a place called Chino's, down the road from me. It does great Italian food.</p> <p>Where is the best place to shop for groceries?</p> <p>I think the supermarkets are good to get cheap things, such as the everyday items like tinned food and toiletries, but local stores are better for meat and vegetables because they are always fresh.</p> <p>How do you get to the shops when you go for food?</p> <p>I usually go by car, but occasionally by bike if the weather is ok and I don't need to buy too much. The car can obviously be better if it's the weekly shopping and you need to purchase a lot.</p> <p>Why do you think there is a problem with obesity in many countries?</p> <p>I think it is principally to do with diet and time. People don't have a lot of time so they eat fast food. The lack of time also means that people don't do enough exercise.</p> <p>Who should be dealing with obesity?</p> <p>The government should do something, such as making producers label food packaging clearly, but individuals also have to take responsibility for their own weight and life-style.</p>",

If you can&rsquo;t speak much because you are nervous then you may get a lower score as the examiner needs to hear you speak as much as possible in order to assess your skills.</p>\n<p>If you speak freely and confidently then you may get a score you did not expect!</p> <p>Extend Your Answers</p> <p>Of all the IELTS speaking tips, this is probably one of the most important! The examiners job is to assess your speaking, so if you say very little, he/she will not be able to do this.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t give one word answers such as &lsquo;yes&rsquo; and &lsquo;no&rsquo; and leave it at that. Your job is to give the examiner as much language as possible to assess, so speak as much as you can.</p> <p>Stay on Topic</p> <p>It's important to extend your answers as mentioned above, but make sure you stay on topic &ndash; don&rsquo;t talk about anything that comes into your head if it is not answering the question!</p> <p>Don't Rely on the Examiner</p> <p>The examiner usually won&rsquo;t prompt you to say more if you don&rsquo;t say enough, so it&rsquo;s up to you to give a full answer to each question.</p>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t, then the interview will be over very quickly and you may not be happy with your score!</p> <p>Understand the Questions</p> <p>If you do not understand a question, then ask the examiner to repeat it. Don&rsquo;t try to answer it the first time if you have not understood or heard it properly.</p>\n<p>You won&rsquo;t lose marks for asking for a question to be repeated, however if you are unable to understand a lot of the questions you are probably not ready to take the test!</p> <p>Don't Show Off</p> <p>You want to do your best to impress the examiner, but try to keep within your capabilities. If you try to use lots of grammar structures and vocabulary that you are not confident about, you may simply bring down your score.</p> <p>Keep Eye Contact</p> <p>Try to have eye contact with the examiner. This does not mean you need to look at him/her all the time, but it is normal when you have a conversation with someone to spend quite a lot of time looking at them as that keeps their attention.</p>\n<p>If you are speaking with someone and they never look at you this feels quite strange!</p> <p>Listen Carefully</p> <p>Listen very carefully to the questions so you are answering them correctly. For example, if you are asked about an event in the past, make sure you answer using the past tense.</p> <p>Be on Time</p>\n<p>These IELTS speaking tips will not be much use to you if you are not on time! You are going to get off to a bad start if you have upset the examiner because you have kept them waiting so arrive in plenty of time!</p>",

In this lesson we&rsquo;ll look at using &lsquo;as &hellip; as&rsquo;.</p> <p>Uses</p> <p>a) We use &lsquo;as &hellip; as&rsquo; with an adverb or an adjective to make an equal or unequal comparison:</p> <p>i) Living in the UK has been as enjoyable as I&rsquo;d expected it would be.</p>\n<p>ii) My brother and I both play the piano but I don&rsquo;t play as well as he does.</p> <p>b) You often find &lsquo;as &hellip; as&rsquo; used with &lsquo;much&rsquo; or &lsquo;many&rsquo; (sometimes with a noun) to express amounts or quantities:</p> <p>i) Since I&rsquo;ve started to work part-time I&rsquo;m not earning as much (money) as I used to.</p>\n<p>ii) I like my language school because classes don&rsquo;t have as many students as in other places I&rsquo;ve studied.</p> <p>c) You can modify &lsquo;as &hellip; as&rsquo; with adverbs like &lsquo;almost&rsquo;, &lsquo;nearly&rsquo;, &lsquo;not quite&rsquo; and &lsquo;nowhere near&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>If the difference between the two items is only slight, we can use &lsquo;almost&rsquo;, &lsquo;nearly&rsquo; or &lsquo;not quite&rsquo;.</p> <p>i) Speaking online with Skype is almost as good as being face-to-face with the person.</p>\n<p>ii) I thought things would be cheaper in this country but they are nearly as expensive as where I come from.</p>\n<p>iii) My exam results were not quite as good as I was hoping for.</p> <p>To emphasize the difference between two things you can use &lsquo;not nearly&rsquo; or &lsquo;nowhere near&rsquo; with &lsquo;as &hellip; as&rsquo;.</p> <p>i) I&rsquo;ve seen the film but it was not nearly as good as the book.</p>\n<p>ii) Winter in Australia is nowhere near as cold as where I come from.</p> <p>Rephrase it!</p> <p>Proof of an advanced level of English is your ability to say the same thing in different ways.

We usually stress these verbs to show we&rsquo;re being critical:</p> <p>i) Our teacher will insist on giving us lots of homework.</p>\n<p>ii) She would do that. That&rsquo;s just like her.</p> <p>d) We can use &lsquo;would&rsquo; to express the future when we&rsquo;re describing a past time:</p> <p>I had no idea when I was younger that I would be studying abroad in the future.</p> <p>e) &lsquo;Would&rsquo; can be used to give advice:</p> <p>If I were you I would certainly try to visit my country in the spring.</p> <p>f) &lsquo;Will&rsquo; and &lsquo;would&rsquo; are often found in statements when we&rsquo;re hypothesising about the past, the present or the future:</p> <p>i) I would have made more progress at school if I&rsquo;d worked harder. (past)</p>\n<p>ii) I would imagine people who are rich spend less time worrying about money. (present)</p>\n<p>iii) Of course I can&rsquo;t be sure but I think I&rsquo;ll pass the exam. (future)</p> <p>g) Both &lsquo;would&rsquo; and &lsquo;used to&rsquo; describe past habits or events that no longer happen, but there are differences between the two. We use &lsquo;would&rsquo; if we&rsquo;re describing a repeated action in the past (and if it&rsquo;s a happy memory, such as in the first example below, &lsquo;would&rsquo; is a good choice). &lsquo;Used to&rsquo; in comparison can also describe states and situations:</p> <p>i) When I was younger my grandfather would/used to bring us chocolate when he visited.</p>\n<p>ii) I used to live in Madrid until I went to university. (not &lsquo;would&rsquo;)</p>\n<p>ii) I used to drive a motorbike before I bought my car. (not &lsquo;would&rsquo;)</p> <p>Over to you</p> <p>Practise the use of &lsquo;would&rsquo; and &lsquo;used to&rsquo; to describe past habits. Cast your mind back to a happy period in your childhood that you can describe. Remember to use &lsquo;would&rsquo; to describe actions that are a happy memory and &lsquo;used to&rsquo; to describe simple actions, or states. For example:</p> <p>My childhood was a happy time. My parents never used to have a great deal of money but we generally managed to keep ourselves entertained. My father used to be very busy but whenever he had the chance he would take the time to read us bedtime stories. And mum would always find the money to treat us now and again.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Did you notice that the adverbs in each of the statements above are in the wrong place? In this lesson we&rsquo;ll look at how you can avoid making similar mistakes. (See the bottom of the page for these statements corrected.)</p> <p>Uses</p> <p>Adverbs are words that modify other words, phrases or clauses. For example:</p> <p>i) I usually spend 1 or 2 hours doing homework every day.</p>\n<p>ii) I also speak a little German.</p>\n<p>iii) Luckily, I found a good school near my apartment.</p> <p>There are no &lsquo;absolute&rsquo; rules for the position of all adverbs and you&rsquo;ll find many exceptions to the guidelines below. However, to help you make the right decisions it&rsquo;s useful to have an understanding of why adverbs are used.</p> <p>a) Adverbs that are used to describe an adjective or another adverb will often be placed immediately before these words. For example:</p> <p>i) The clothes in my favourite shop are quite cheap.</p>\n<p>ii) Since I enrolled for the exam I&rsquo;ve been working really hard.</p> <p>b) Comment adverbs are words like &lsquo;obviously&rsquo;, &lsquo;clearly&rsquo; or &lsquo;hopefully&rsquo;. These are generally OK to place before the subject and sometimes between the subject and main verb. For example:</p> <p>i) Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll pass my driving test first time. I&rsquo;ll hopefully pass &hellip;</p>\n<p>ii) Fortunately, my father has his own business so I might work with him.</p> <p>Remember to put the adverb before the main verb but after an auxiliary verb like &lsquo;will&rsquo;, &lsquo;be&rsquo; or &lsquo;have&rsquo;. For example, this would be regarded as unnatural or even incorrect:</p> <p>I hopefully will pass my driving test &hellip; (X)</p> <p>c) Adverbs of indefinite frequency, like &lsquo;always&rsquo;, &lsquo;often&rsquo;, &lsquo;usually&rsquo;, &lsquo;sometimes&rsquo; or &lsquo;never&rsquo; are generally safe to put between the subject and the main verb (but after the auxiliary verb). For example:</p> <p>i) We usually visit my grandparents every weekend.</p>\n<p>ii) I&rsquo;ve never been to America but I hope to go one day.</p> <p>d) Focus adverbs are used to focus attention on specific information in a clause rather than individual words. Focus adverbs include words like &lsquo;just&rsquo;, &lsquo;only&rsquo; and &lsquo;even&rsquo;. The position of these adverbs is similar to those above, that is they go between the subject and the main verb (but after the auxiliary verb). For example:</p> <p>i) My computer is so old it can&rsquo;t even connect to the Internet.</p>\n<p>ii) I&rsquo;ve only just started attending English lessons.</p> <p>However, focus adverbs can also be placed elsewhere, depending on which part of the statement is being emphasised. For example:</p> <p>i) My younger brother can even play chess. (The speaker thinks this is surprising)</p>\n<p>ii) Even my younger brother can play chess. (The speaker thinks chess is easy)</p> <p>e) Adverbs of time such as &lsquo;yesterday&rsquo; or &lsquo;last month&rsquo; and adverbs of definite frequency such as &lsquo;daily&rsquo;, &lsquo;weekly&rsquo; or &lsquo;every year&rsquo; normally go at the end of the clause:</p> <p>i) My parents go to the same holiday resort every summer.</p>\n<p>ii) I took the IELTS exam last year.</p> <p>f) Adverbs of manner such as &lsquo;slowly&rsquo;, &lsquo;quietly&rsquo; or &lsquo;carefully&rsquo; usually go at the end of the clause:</p> <p>i) I play the guitar quite well.</p>\n<p>ii) After I went to England I think my English improved quickly.</p> <p>  </p>\n<p>Over to you</p> <p>1) How often do you do the following? Use adverbs of frequency like &lsquo;sometimes&rsquo;, &lsquo;often&rsquo;, &lsquo;rarely&rsquo; or &lsquo;never&rsquo; in your answers:</p> <p>go swimming</p>\n<p>oversleep</p>\n<p>travel abroad</p>\n<p>take risks</p>\n<p>eat chocolate</p>\n<p>2) Respond to the following using the adverb in brackets:</p> <p>a film you have seen (recently)</p>\n<p>a job that you haven&rsquo;t finished (yet/still)</p>\n<p>something you did 10 minutes ago (just)</p>\n<p>your favourite national cuisine (especially)</p>\n<p>the reason you are learning English (mainly)</p>\n<p>something you do (well)</p>\n<p>Corrected statements</p> <p>The correct word order in the statements at the top of the page is:</p> <p>i) I am usually quite good at getting up early to go to college.</p>\n<p>ii) I recently started an English course.</p>\n<p>iii) I still haven&rsquo;t applied to go to any universities and I need to soon.</p>\n<p>  </p>",

That&rsquo;s because IELTS is a test of what you CAN do, not what you can&rsquo;t. So say as much as you can in response to the question, until you run out of ideas or start repeating yourself. It&rsquo;s not a bad thing if the examiner has to interrupt you.</p> <p>IELTS Speaking Tip 2: Use an idiom or two</p> <p>According to the assessment criteria, an IELTS Band 7 candidate:</p> <p>Uses some less common and idiomatic vocabulary and shows some awareness of style and collocation</p>\n<p>The IELTS examiner is listening for evidence that you can go beyond &lsquo;textbook English&rsquo; and start using real, idiomatic English. So impress the examiner by including a few idiomatic phrases like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bundle of nerves&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nervous&rdquo;.</p> <p>IELTS Speaking Tip 3: Paraphrase the question</p> <p>According to the assessment criteria, an IELTS Band 7 candidate:</p> <p>Uses paraphrase effectively</p>\n<p>If the examiner asks you a question and you can immediately think of a way to paraphrase it&mdash;i.e. express the same meaning in other words&mdash;go ahead and say something like &ldquo;Oh, you mean (paraphrase question)?&rdquo; This is a very effective strategy to demonstrate one of the core skills that the examiner is listening for. Try to do this two or three times during the test.</p> <p>IELTS Speaking Tip 4: Use linking words to connect your ideas</p> <p>According to the assessment criteria, an IELTS Band 7 candidate:</p> <p>Uses a range of connectives and discourse markers with some flexibility</p>\n<p>What does this mean in normal English? It means that you use a range of expressions like &lsquo;in other words&rsquo;, &lsquo;also&rsquo;, &lsquo;however&rsquo; and &lsquo;on the other hand&rsquo; to connect your ideas. The key word is range. The examiner doesn&rsquo;t want to hear you say &lsquo;on the other hand&rsquo; a hundred times! So record yourself speaking and notice if you use a phrase like &lsquo;on the other hand&rsquo; too much. If so, use a different phrase instead. Now you can start demonstrating a good range of linking words.</p> <p>  </p>\n<p>IELTS Speaking Tip 5: Don&rsquo;t be afraid of mistakes</p> <p>According to the assessment criteria, an IELTS Band 7 candidate:</p> <p>Frequently produces error-free sentences, though some grammatical mistakes persist</p>\n<p>That means it&rsquo;s possible to make some mistakes and still get IELTS 7.0 or 7.5. However, some candidates score poorly because they worry too much about mistakes. As a result, they speak too slowly and their mistakes become MORE obvious! It&rsquo;s more important to demonstrate fluency (See Tip #1) than it is to produce error-free speech. Of course, it&rsquo;s also good to correct yourself if you do notice a mistake.</p>",

        "content": "<p>One of the 4 criteria the IELTS Speaking module is assessed on is fluency and coherence. What does this mean?</p> <p>Fluency is the ability to maintain a flow of language without unnatural hesitation.</p> <p>Coherence is the logical organization, development and connection of ideas.</p> <p>Do you express ideas and opinions clearly and coherently (logically ordered and easy to follow), without long pauses or hesitations?</p> <p>Do you use discourse markers appropriately and naturally (i.e. you don&rsquo;t overuse the same few ones) to link your ideas?</p> <p>Do you stay on topic, develop your ideas but not &ldquo;go in circles&rdquo; (repeating yourself) or &ldquo;go off on a tangent&rdquo; (moving off the topic)?</p> <p>Unfortunately, there is no quick fix for this. Fluency comes from a lot of practice speaking, so the best way to improve is to speak/engage in conversation as often as you can! But you can really think about your strategy for coherence and practice. When answering a question remember to:</p> <p>Expand on your answer. Think of logical details that the examiner would want to know about. If someone else were talking to you, you would naturally have questions to find out more. What are those questions? Who? What? Where? When? Why? How? How much? How often? How good? How did you feel? Expand on your answer by adding those details that make it interesting.</p> <p>Where appropriate, explain how you feel about something &ndash; it gives emphasis to your reasons and details</p> <p>Where appropriate, describe a person, thing or place</p> <p>Think of a logical order or sequence. Don&rsquo;t jump around from one part to another. The examiner doesn&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re thinking in your head, so you should try to make your answer easy to follow.</p> <p>Use common conversational discourse markers to signal how your sentences and ideas are linked together. Here are some examples:</p> <p>well, &ndash; this has a lot of different uses, but mostly at the beginning of speaking in response to the other speaker</p> <p>ex. &ldquo;Well, I would say my favorite trip was the one I took with my family to the Philippines for the first time.&rdquo;</p> <p>actually &ndash; used to state a fact or reality, or for stating a correction, or sometimes to signal that what you&rsquo;re going to say may be unexpected</p> <p>ex. &ldquo;Actually, I think it was the first time for my parents to go back to their home country in about 20 years.&rdquo;</p> <p>as for &ndash; used in the same sense as &ldquo;regarding&rdquo; or &ldquo;in regard to&rdquo; which can be more formal</p> <p>ex. &ldquo;As for the food, I found the it to be really fresh and light.&rdquo;</p> <p>basically &ndash; when you want to simplify or summarize a complicated or lengthy story/idea</p> <p>ex. &ldquo;Basically, we were there to visit relatives my parents hadn&rsquo;t seen since they were young and for me to get to know my parents&rsquo; home country.&rdquo;</p> <p>I mean &ndash; used to clarify what was just said or say it in different words</p> <p>ex. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t at all what I expected. I mean, I thought I knew a lot about the culture and the food, but it was so different being there.&rdquo;</p> <p>on the other hand &ndash; used to introduce a different view or alternative opinion</p> <p>ex. &ldquo;The big crowds on the streets made it really difficult to walk around. On the other hand, it made it exciting to be surrounded by so many people.&rdquo;</p> <p>anyway &ndash; to move on to another point or close the conversation</p> <p>as I was saying &ndash; to bring the topic back to the original point</p> <p>the thing is &ndash; to raise an important point</p> <p>ex. &rdquo; The thing is, I think the trip was just as memorable for my parents as it was for me. They were so proud to show off their hometown.&rdquo;</p> <p>at the same time &ndash; used to contrast what was previously said</p> <p>ex. &ldquo;It was fun enjoying summer weather during Christmas. At the same time, it didn&rsquo;t really feel like Christmas to me.&rdquo;</p>",

        "content": "<com.ielts.preparation>Part 1 - Introduction</com.ielts.preparation> <p>Q. Good afternoon. My name is Kristina Pollock. Could I have your name, please?</p>\n<p>A. Good afternoon Madam. My name is Joseph Mark and my nickname is Mark.</p> <p>Q. And your candidate number?</p>\n<p>A. My candidate number is...</p> <p>Q. Thank you. Now could you tell me a little about yourself and where do you live?</p>\n<p>A. Well, I'm Joseph Mark and I live at... My father's name is... He is a Government service holder. My mother's name is... She is basically a housewife but sometimes she works at our shop. I'm 26 and I've finished my graduation from... University. My major was Mathematics. I've got 2 brothers and a younger sister. We live like a very happy family and my parents take great care of us. I'm doing a part-time job at a local school as a Mathematics teacher. I'm planning to complete my M.Sc. from any reputed University of the UK. My future plan is to teach in a college. I spend my leisure time surfing the internet and reading books. Sometimes I hang around with my friends on the lake shore. The place I live now is really charming and I love to live there. It's not noisy and busy like other cities and I have got many friends there. I am maintaining a personal blog and there I try to add a post every week. This is basically a technology and Math related blog.</p> <p>Q. What are some of the nicest things about where you live?</p>\n<p>A. The place where I live in is a calm area and is very neat and clean. You will find it naturally beautiful and the lakes, gardens, fountain, river, hill and the songs of birds will take your heart away. Whenever my friends from other cities come to visit my area, they become awestricken! Our area is indeed a beautiful place to live in. The people are very nice and friendly and you would be very pleased with their charming behaviours if you visit there. The area is free of pollution as it is not an industrial area and the fresh air would give a soothing feeling. The traffic on the road is good most of the time and you won't have to worry about the public transportation as they are available around the clock. This area is famous for many historical sites and monuments like (...say some names here...) and many tourists come to visit here every day. The tour guides are very nice and are maintained by Government. There are many restaurants there and you can pick one of your delicious menus from there and I am sure you will never forget the taste! People in our area lead simple yet friendly lives and they make friends easily. The crime rate is pretty low and as a small town, we know other members of our area.</p>\n<p>I am sure if you visit our area once, you will simply love it.</p> <p>Q. Are there any places of special interest I could visit in your home area?</p>\n<p>A. The Gomez River and Roar Hills are two most beautiful places in our area. Thousands of tourists each month come to visit our area and these two places are main attractions for the tourists.</p> <p>Apart from that, some monuments of famous politicians, poets and renowned persons in the Family Square is one of the main attractions and it is worth visiting. The hill hiking, swimming and fishing are three most popular activities among tourists and I would recommend those activities to you. You will never get bored there and if you even slightly do, simply get yourself enrolled in the government managed tour plans for a couple of days. This would give you a whole new chance to explore hills, rivers, forests and you would find challenges and enthralling experiences from there. Lastly, do not forget to taste our local foods and fruits.</p> <p>Take the chance to visit our area and I am sure you would start recommending your friends after that.</p> <p>Q. Could you describe some of them for me?</p>\n<p>A. The Gomez River is a long river that passes through our town. The water is crystal clear and you can see the fishes, corals and other objects inside it. The water is surprisingly warm and when you will look at it, you will be surprised to see all the fishes there. It is like a large aquarium. The reflection of the sky gives it a heavenly look and many people go there for picnic and fishing there. In the evening children and parents play in the fields beside the river and you can find some newly constructed motels and restaurants there. Swimming in this river is a popular activity among local people and tourists in the summer season.</p> <p>The Roar hill is another beautiful site in our area and it got its names from the roaring echo sound it creates. There are several hills there and they are over 300- 500 feet tall. The vista, illusionary sound of birds, the natural beauty and fountains give it a painted picture like looks. In the evening when the sun starts hiding behind the hills, people look at this out-of-the-world scenery simply in amazement.</p> <p>Q. What would be the best way for me to get there?</p>\n<p>A. If you have a private car with you, you can drive along the roads and reach there. From the city centre, both of the destinations would be around 1 and half hour&rsquo;s journey. Alternatively, you can take a public bus or hire a small car and reach there. The rent/ticket fee of the public transportation is fixed and you do not need to pay any extra charge.</p> <p>If you enrol with the tour service provider, they will manage the plan, route and based on your preference, you can either share a zip or can take a private car for rent. The later one is comparatively expensive.</p> <p>Q. What sort of places could I stay at?</p>\n<p>A. You can stay at a tourist motel near the hills or can rent a hotel room in the city centre. If you are visiting your family members, then villa near the hill road would be better alternatives for you. Almost every tourist motel provides meals facility.</p> <p>Q. Should I go at any special time of year?</p>\n<p>A. Most of the tourists come to our area during the summer season and I would recommend you to visit during summer as well. There are lots of activities you can do during this period and you will find the beauty of our city at that time.</p> <p>[ I see, this has all been very interesting.]</p> <p>  </p>\n<com.ielts.preparation>Part 2 - Cue Card</com.ielts.preparation> <p>Topic:</p> <p>Describe a problem that affects the environment in the area where you live.</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>what the problem is</p>\n<p>what causes it</p>\n<p>what people feel about the problem</p>\n<p>and explain what you think could be done to solve it.</p> <p>  </p>\n<p>A. There are so many problems that negatively affect the environment in our area and among these, the density of population, in my opinion, is the most severe one. While in many countries, less than 100 people live in one square kilometre, we have got around thousand of people living in one square kilometre. Because of this high population and population density in city areas, lots of problems are arising.</p> <p>The expenditure to support living is quite high compared to the average earning of the people, a heavy traffic has become a common scenario in the roads and as a consequence, lots of time is killed every day. The lower economic people are not getting the proper education and hospital facility, crime has increased than ever, lots of unplanned and risky constructions have been established, the environment is getting polluted and seems like no one cares.</p> <p>There are many reasons that caused this outburst of this mass population in our city and among those, the most influential reason is the centralization of industry in this city. Most of the factory, offices and organisations are located in this city and people from all area of the country are coming here to find a living. The unemployment in rural areas is another reason why people are trying to stay here. The political reason not to take strict decisions on making equal opportunity in the country is another reason. The businesses and job opportunity attract people to come and live here in this city.</p> <p>People can feel the heat of this uncontrolled population and the problems are creating for that but they have little control over it. We all suffer from the problems and talk about it but I have not seen any big movement to solve this problem. On the other hand, the political leaders who can take initiatives to lessen the problem are sometimes corrupted to take appropriate and honest steps.</p> <p>There are lots of theories to solve this problem and seems like we all know about it. First of all, decentralisation should be done and industries and factories that can be moved to other areas should be moved promptly. Proper education and job sectors should be ensured so that people can earn their living at their cities rather than coming here. Local government can be formed to support and improve each area of the country. Each local government should be able to invest and decide about the development projects in their area.</p> <p>People naturally want to live in a better place where they can find the necessary infrastructure, daily needs and can earn a living. If that can be ensured throughout the country, this problem can be reduced.</p> <p>  </p>\n<com.ielts.preparation>Part 3 - Details Discussion</com.ielts.preparation> <p>Q. Tell me, what do you think are the greatest problems facing your country at present?</p>\n<p>A. Economic development issue, political instability, unemployment and healthcare are the major issues most of the people in my country face. In my opinion, these are the most burning issues and the greatest problems we have in our country.</p> <p>Q. And what has been done so far to solve these problems?</p>\n<p>A. The government has taken many initiatives for the economic progress of our country. According to the statistics, we are indeed progressing. But I am not convinced with the reported statistics. I want to see the result, I want to feel it. The political instability seems like consuming most of our good will and energy. While major political parties should have worked together to help improve our economic conditions, sometimes their actions give me real doubt whether they are the type of leaders we need for our country!</p> <p>On the positive sides, government has emphasized on ICT sector, has made the export process easier for business people, established many training institutes to enhance the skill of the rural people and those are all hopeful signs. Someday definitely we will see the progress. Education, skill, foreign investment, job security etc. are also important areas where the government has invested a lot of money. The aim of this investment is to create a skilled and educated generation who would lead the economy and the country.</p> <p>The health care section is still an expensive area for the mass people and the government&rsquo;s initiatives for the establishment of new hospitals, enrolling more doctors and nurses are in reality very little compared to the actual need.</p> <p>Q. How successful would you say these measures have been?</p>\n<p>A. These measures are successful to some extent but if I present it in figures, it would only a few percentages than the actual progress we expect. For instance: more than three thousand hospitals are required throughout the country whereas only 45 hospitals have been established in the last one year.</p> <p>Q. Do you think things are likely to get better or worse in the future?</p>\n<p>A. We hope that the problem we have in our country would be resolved in next few years. The government and other organisations are working hard to address these issues and we are noticing some progress. So we can definitely be positive and wait for the glorious days when we won&rsquo;t have those issues. This was an optimistic idea and I possess this positive idea about my country. But the greatest obstacle is the hunger for power and our political parties often create haphazard situations for the power. This is the single reason that can degrade the situation in the future.</p> <p>Q. Is what you are going to study likely to be of any use to solve these problems?</p>\n<p>A. I am going to finish my graduation majoring Computer Science and I am very positive that it would directly or indirectly help eradicate unemployment, economic progress issues to some extent that I have talked about. After finishing my education, I would establish a small software company and hopefully one day it would grow to be a large company where thousands of employees would work. The ICT sector also helps earn foreign remittance for a country and I would also contribute to enhance the foreign remittance for my country.</p>",

        "content": "<h5>Part 1 - Introduction</h5> <p>Q. Good Morning. Could you tell me your name and candidate number, please?</p>\n<p>A. Good Morning. I am Rahul Sharma and my candidate number is&hellip;...</p> <p>Q. And what would you like me to call you?</p>\n<p>A. Please call me Rahul. That&rsquo;s my nickname.</p> <p>Q. Tell me a bit about your family.</p>\n<p>A. Well, I live in a joint family and there are almost 20 family members in this family. My grandpa, grandma, my parents, sisters, my uncles and their children are living in a joint family and that makes it a large family. My grandpa was a teacher and he is now around 70 years old. My father owns a small business and two of my uncle work there. My mother is a house wife and she takes care of me, my sisters and cousins. I have two sisters who are younger than me are in school. My father mostly takes care of the financial part of our family and he is the main earning member of our family. The house we live in quite big and it has more than 15 rooms in total.</p> <p>That&rsquo;s the summary of my family members. If there is anything particular you would like to know about my family, I would be happy to answer.</p> <p>Q. What do your brothers and sisters do?</p>\n<p>A. I have not got any brother of my own. I have two sisters and both of them are students. The older one, Radhika, reads in class ten while the younger one, Dina, reads in class seven. Besides study sometimes they help my mother on her housework and often help my cousins to prepare their homework. My sisters are very close to me and I like them so much. They are both very adorable.</p> <p>Q. So, where are you from?</p>\n<p>A. I am from ...&hellip; (tell the City/ Village/ Area name) of &hellip;... (District/ County/ Area/State name). I was born in this city but for my university education I, later on, moved to ..&hellip;. (Area name). Currently, I am living at &hellip;&hellip; (Your present area) and I came here from my current living place.</p> <p>Q. What are the advantages and disadvantages of living here?</p>\n<p>A. The place where I am currently living is a busy and residential area.</p> <p>Among advantages I would say:</p> <p>It is a secured area as there are guards and police cars often roam in the streets. There are very few incidences to bother about.</p>\n<p>People are nice and amiable.</p>\n<p>The internet, cyber caf&eacute;, library and other facilities are available.</p>\n<p>Transportation facility is another advantage of this area. You do not need to wait for a long in the queue to get a public car.</p>\n<p>Amusement park, gardens, playgrounds, shopping complex and other community facilities are nearby.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is no industry or commercial building there to pollute the air or sound.</p>\n<p>Overall, I enjoy living there and compared to my previous living place, this is many times better.</p> <p>Now among the disadvantages, I would mention that:</p> <p>The rent of the houses and apartments are comparatively higher and it is rising every year.</p>\n<p>The entrance gate of my area closes at 11:00 pm and that&rsquo;s why I have to worry about returning home before 11:00 pm even after I have important tasks outside.</p>\n<p>The roads are busy during the school and office time.</p>\n<p>The last problem I would like to mention is the scarcity of doctors in this area. There is no hospital or medical centre here so people have to go to the city centre to avail this facility if required.</p>\n<p>Q. I'm new here. Could you recommend a good restaurant?</p>\n<p>A. That would depend on your taste of foods and budget. If you want to enjoy the natural views and taste the local foods, I would recommend you to go to (Mark Polo Restaurant). It is nearby- would not take more than 20 minutes in a car.</p> <p>Now if you want to taste other menus like Chinese, Italian, Indian, Thai, or European foods, your best deal would be the Dela Mono restaurant. They are bit expensive but their foods are delicious.</p> <p>Finally, if you want to enjoy your foods and have some refreshment like music, you should better go to WestInn and as far as I know it is quite expensive. To taste cheap fast foods you can visit the small restaurants nearby the New Market area. In fact, I often go there and I enjoy their foods.</p> <p>Q. Why do you like it?</p>\n<p>A. I like quick foods and they are delicious. They offer ready foods at a low budget and that&rsquo;s why I like it very much. Apart from that, New Market area is only 10 minutes distance from my university and having foods from those restaurants is convenient for me.</p> <p>Q. What types of foods does it serve?</p>\n<p>A. It serves only fast foods and quick meals including the burger, sandwich, pizza, fried chicken, fried rice with vegetables, all type of soft drinks and lassi. If you want to have lunch or dinner, you can order the set menu that includes: fried rice, vegetable, chicken, curry and other local items. Lassi and pizza are my two favourite foods of this restaurants and I often have these two items.</p> <p>Q. What do you suggest I order?</p>\n<p>A. I would suggest you to order a small California Pizza, one glass of Lassi and a mixed vegetable item. I am quite fond of this menu and enjoy eating it a lot. I am quite sure if you are not a pizza hater, you would also like it.</p> <p>Q. Is it expensive?</p>\n<p>A. Not at all. The whole menu would cost you only a few dollars. If you compare the price of this restaurant to other restaurants, you would find it quite cheap in fact.</p> <p>Q. How do I get there?</p>\n<p>A. The newmarket area is a well-known place so you don&rsquo;t have to worry much. From here you can take a public bus to reach the new market area. After reaching there you need to take a turn to the north and you will see the large banner ads of this restaurants. If you take your private car, you need to reach the City fountain first and then you should turn left. After 5 minutes you will see a large auditorium and then you should turn to your right. Go straight for a couple of more minutes and you are bound to notice the New Market. In case you are not sure about the route at any moment, you should ask any passerby about the location and anyone would be able to tell you the direction.</p> <p>Q. After you have taken the lELTS, what are you planning to study?</p>\n<p>A. I have finished my graduation in Computer Science and I have planned to finish my post-graduation in the same major. After getting my IELTS I would get myself admitted in any renowned university of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>Q. Why are you interested in this?</p>\n<p>A. I have a passion for computer programming and web development. Before deciding to take my undergraduate program in Computer Science, I talk with my teachers, parents and some relatives and they all suggested me to take part in this study. Since I have already completed my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science, I think it would be wise to continue my post-graduation courses in the same subject. Apart from that, the career prospect in Information and Communication sector and more specifically in software engineering is very high in my country. So I am interested in it from my passion, past educational background and because of the career prospect.</p> <p>Q. Why do you want to study overseas?</p>\n<p>A. I always wanted to study in an oversea university as it would ensure a better educational environment and quality education compared to the universities of my country. Apart from that, the opportunity to learn about the diverse cultures and people in a foreign university is something I don&rsquo;t want to miss. Finally, a foreign degree, especially a degree from a reputed USA or UK university is helpful for better career prospect in our country. Considering all of the above-mentioned reasons, I have decided to continue my study at an overseas university.</p> <h5>Part 2 - Cue Card</h5> <p>Topic:</p> <p>Describe a course you took in your college or university.</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>what it was</p>\n<p>when you took it</p>\n<p>what you learned from this course</p>\n<p>And explain why you took this course.</p> <p>A. &lsquo;Book Keeping &amp; Banking&rsquo; was one of the most interesting courses I took in my university level and I thoroughly enjoyed this course. In fact, I learned many new concepts and theory from this course that it helped me a lot throughout the remaining semesters. This was a mandatory course in the 3rd semester in my Bachelor of Business Administration studies and the courses on this subject lasted for four months. I was so interested in this course that later on, I took three other courses in different semesters related to banking.</p> <p>I learned the accounting concept of banking, how a bank is operated, how the banking transactions and accounting are maintained, how the central banks control the money supply of the market and many more concepts from this course. A practical session was included in this course and I learned some basic transaction processes of bankers from this lab sessions.</p> <p>In my third semester, this was a mandatory course and I had no alternatives other than taking this course. I came from Science background until my undergraduate course and that&rsquo;s why I had no prior accounting course experience. I was bit dubious about this course in my university level as I did not know what it includes. But after I completed this course, I found myself very much interested in Banking procedure and automated banking.</p> <h5>Part 3 - Details Discussion.</h5> <p>[OK, good. I would like to go back to you now.]</p> <p>Q. How do you think studying overseas will be different to studying in your own country?</p>\n<p>A. Studying in a foreign country is far different than studying in the home country. First of all, a student would have to leave his family, relatives, friends and stay in a different country to continue his/ her study in a foreign university. In home country s/he has the option to either attend classes from home or to stay in the university residence halls. In the second case, s/he can meet family and relatives frequently and can make new friends very quickly. While studying in a foreign university, students often suffer from homesickness and have to get enrolled in part-time jobs to support his/ her expenses. While studying overseas universities students can learn about different custom, culture and tradition. Overseas universities are often better in quality than home universities and thus overseas universities offer quality education and this has a better prospect in the future career. Among other differences, the language, communication and exam systems might be different. Finally, an overseas university offers latest and up to date curriculum while home universities, especially in less developed countries, might lack the proper study environment and proper syllabus.</p> <p>Q. So what problems do you think you will have studying abroad?</p>\n<p>A. I will miss my family members and I think for the first few weeks this would be terrible. All my life I lived with my family members and being in a foreign country would mean that I can contact them over the phone and have video calls, but can&rsquo;t spend time with them in person.</p> <p>The language barrier would be another problem. My English is better than average but still understanding and communicating with people of a different country who have a different accent is sometimes an unavoidable problem. Hopefully, this won&rsquo;t last for a long as I am a quick learner and I will try my best to learn the manner, custom and accent of this country very quickly.</p> <p>Another problem that might arrive is loneliness. This is going to be a new country and I won&rsquo;t have any friends and relatives. So the first few days would be lonely I guess. Travelling and not knowing the route and bus number would be another problem. The different kinds of foods in this country might be a problem as I am habituated to eat common types of foods available in my country. It might happen that I won&rsquo;t find foods of my preference near my living place.</p> <p>Finally finding a senior student, classmate or a teacher who would spend some time to explain some of the lessons that I might find difficult would be another problem I guess. In my country, I always had resources and helping hands for my studies. I guess that would not be available initially in a new country where I would go for study.</p> <p>I think these are the main issues I will face in first few weeks after I arrive in a different country to study.</p> <p>Q. Do you think you will have many difficulties adapting to a new culture?</p>\n<p>A. I guess it would not be much difficult for me to adapt to a new culture as I am already exposed to diverse customs and cultures in my home country. But of course, it is a bit tough to adapt a new culture very, especially when the culture and tradition are quite different from my home country. But I have the confidence that I won&rsquo;t face many difficulties there, especially related to the new culture, as I already did my research on common customs and traditions of this new country. So nothing would be completely new and shocking for me, I hope.</p> <p>Q. Do you think that there will be any major changes in your field of study over the next few years?</p>\n<p>A. Yes, the subject Computer Science by its nature changes over time. Since this is a pure technology-based subject unlike other subjects like History, Mathematics, Arts etc. changes are very obvious. Programming languages and computer hardware are ever changing from the very beginning and many changed would occur in my field of study.</p> <p>The courses change very frequently and many new algorithms are introduced to make the computing and software development more efficient. For instance, the data security, search mechanism, encryptions are very core subjects of Computer Science and they are changing very fast. It is not unlikely that new computing concept would emerge and that would be included in my field of study.</p> <p>Q. How do you think an overseas degree will improve your professional skills?</p>\n<p>A. I am planning to have an overseas degree mainly because of the finest quality and facilities this university can offer in my area of study. The overseas degree would actually ensure a better study environment and learning opportunity for me. Thus I would be able to learn better and have better skills to pursue a better career.</p> <p>In my country, a foreign degree is given a priority in case of a job interview. Many local and international organisations even mention that a foreign degree from a reputed university would be a plus for the candidate. So I am sure having a foreign degree would open more opportunity for me in my professional life.</p> <p>The foreign universities, especially universities of first world countries, are renowned for their professionalism, study environment and facilities to learn better skills. I am sure I would be able to take advantages of these facilities and would be able to learn more. The top notch universities of a first world country are often renowned for their research and I will put every effort to get involved in such research facilities to enhance my skills.</p> <p>Q. What do you intend to do once you have finished your studies?</p>\n<p>A. I will get admitted in my Master's degree in few months and after I finish my studies, I would get back to my country. Once I get back to my country, I will start applying for a suitable job. In fact, the job would be the place where I would be able to learn even more and use the knowledge I have learned in the past few years and will learn in next two years.</p> <p>So in a nutshell, starting a job related to my study to enhance my skill would be the first thing I will do after I finish my graduation. Apart from that, I have a plan to work on a personal eCommerce project that I have been planning for years. The potential of eCommerce in my home country is immense and I would try to tap in this sector to establish a large eCommerce business.</p> <p>These are the plans I have now for my immediate future but time often drives us to new tracks and different motivations. So if something bigger and better comes across my pathway, I will plan accordingly then.</p> <p>Q. What do you see yourself doing professionally in 10 years' time? And how do you see your personal life changing?</p>\n<p>A. Umm, predicting what I will be doing after 10 years is bit tricky! But if everything goes according to my plan and the Almighty drives me to the right track, I will own my own Ecommerce business after 10 years. I will be able to quit my day job at that time and would be able to fully concentrate on my own business. E-commerce would not be the only thing where I would be working then. At that time I will own some of the prominent and large software nationally and internationally. I have a plan to establish a night school in my hometown and hopefully in ten years that would be renowned one and a role model for the people of my locality.</p> <p>After 10 years I will probably be a married person with 1-2 kids of my own. That would be a big change I guess. There would be many responsibilities and new ways of life. I will devote more on doing humanitarian things than concentrating more on personal gains. Probably my choices of dresses, foods, music, movies and books would change and I would become more matured. Finally, I will have fewer friends than I have now but they would be very close. My relationship with my co-workers and employees would be more prominent than my relationship with my university or college friends. I think those are very significant changed that are most likely to take place in my personal life after 10 years or so.</p>",

        "content": "<h5>PART 1 - Introduction:</h5>\n<p>[The examiner asks the candidate about him/her, his/her home, work or studies and other familiar topics.]</p> <p>Family:</p>\n<p>Q. Do you have a large family or a small family?</p>\n<p>A. I come from a small family. I live with my parents and two siblings. As I recall we used to live with our grandparents, uncles and aunts many years ago. But now we have a nuclear family.</p> <p>Q. Can you tell me something about them?</p>\n<p>A. Yeah sure. My father is a doctor and he has been practising medicine for more than 15 years. He is a devoted doctor and possesses a great and exemplary personality. People think that he has a very controlled personality but we know that he is very kind. I am proud to have such a great father. He is my idol in my life.</p> <p>My mother is an angel and she is the most kindhearted woman I have ever seen in my life. She is a teacher in a school and she teaches literature. She is my best friend and I adore her very much.</p> <p>My brother is 3 years senior to me and he is working in a telecommunication company as a System Analyst. He is around 28 years old and a very good friend and mentor to me.</p> <p>My younger sister is only 12 years old and she is busy with her home works, study and computer. She is very sweet and helps my mother often to finish her household chores. I love her very much and she talks a lot to me. In our house, I am her best friend and I often help her completing her home works.</p> <p>Q. How much time do you manage to spend with members of your family?</p>\n<p>A. I live with my family and I spent most of my time at home with my family members. When I am out of home for my classes or go to hang out with friends are the times I stay away from my family. Apart from that, I mostly spend time with them.</p> <p>I have a very close relationship with my younger sister and my brother. We often go out together to watch movies or to do shopping. We sometimes play computer games together. On an average, I spend 5-7 hours with my family members in a typical day.</p> <p>Q. What sorts of things do you like to do together?</p>\n<p>A. I like to discuss my plans with my father. I often take advice on important things from him. He discusses his experience, tells me history and often he teaches me morality and importance of being honest in life. He recommends me books and then we discuss these books in our free time.</p> <p>I do everything with my brother John. We hang out together, watch movies, read books, sometimes we fight, we often complaints to our parents about what I or he should not have done, we swim, catch fish, play football and many other countless things. Though he is very friendly, he often scolds me whenever he thinks I did something wrong. He even acts like a mentor sometimes. Nowadays, he got busy in his office and that&rsquo;s why we spend our time together on his days off.</p> <p>I play computer games and chess with my sister and she often seeks my advice regarding things she can&rsquo;t decide alone. We watch cartoons and documentary on History Channel together.</p> <p>I love to talk to my mother and she is very fond of feeding us. She often shares her experience at school with us and we often watch TV serials and sports together. She loves to hear some classic music and I have become a fan of her favourite singers. So I often listen to music with her. There are many more activities that actually I do with my family members and those are the frequent ones.</p> <p>Q. Did/ Do you get on well with your family? Why?</p>\n<p>A. Yes, obviously I go well with my family. They are the most precious things I have in my life. They care for me a lot, they help me on my difficult times and my whole existence is surrounded by them. Whoever I am and whoever I become in future would be because of my family members&rsquo; love, care and affections.</p> <p>I have a strong bonding and friendly relationship with my family. They share their thought and everyday experience with me. They always try to support me no matter what and all those mutual understanding makes us a small, happy family.</p> <h5>PART 2 - Cue Card</h5> <p>Topic:</p> <p>Describe a teacher who has influenced you in your education.</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>&bull; where you met him/her.</p>\n<p>&bull; what subject he/she taught.</p>\n<p>&bull; what was special about him/her.</p> <p>and explain why this person influenced you so much.</p> <p>[ You will have to talk about the topic for 1 to 2 minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish. ]</p> <p>A.I consider myself lucky to get several very good teachers throughout my academic years. Among them, I'd like to talk about Mr Smith who was an extraordinary teacher, a really good mentor and who has a great influence in my education.</p> <p>I met Mr Smith when I was in class 4 and he was our math teacher. Initially, we thought that he would be a moody teacher and we would have to be very polite in front of him. This impression came mostly because of his serious face and tidy dress-up. But soon we found that he is a very friendly person and teaches us very well. He never made things complicated and tried over and over again to explain something to us. He had a unique way of teaching. Seems like he would start an interesting story and later we would find that he would relate the math to the story. Thus everything we learned from him was interesting and that's why we remember most of the theory and techniques of math he taught us.</p> <p>I'd say he has a great influence in my education because he made a very strong foundation on Mathematics. Later on, I studied Science and Mathematics was the most important subject. I have always been good at math and that' mainly because of Mr Smith who had a major role in making the subject interesting to me. Before I learned math from Mr Smith, my impression on math was not good and I considered mathematics to be a very difficult and uninteresting subject. But his teaching and influences changed my way of thinking about math and later on math became my one the most favourite subject.</p> <h5>PART 3 - Follow-up Questions</h5> <p>Discussion topics:</p> <p>Developments in education...</p> <p>Q. How has education changed in your country in the last 10 years?</p>\n<p>A. I live in a developing country where the education sector went through numerous changes including the government&rsquo;s more fund allocation in education, more women enrollment in higher studies, changes in academic syllabus etc.</p> <p>During the last 10 years, the most significant change that has happened in the education sector in my country is the people&rsquo;s mentality regarding the necessity of education. Only 20-30 years back many parents showed little interest in sending their kids to school. But that has radically changed in my country and nowadays almost every parent sends their children to school. This is a giant leap in my opinion in terms of the advancement of our education. The government allocated a share portion of its budget to ensure the school's infrastructure, study materials and salary of the teachers and that has been proven effective to build a solid ground to make an education nation. Only in the last 5 years, our literacy rate has almost doubled and I give a major credit to the government for ensuring free education in primary level, special scholarship and monetary rewards to women students.</p> <p>I am not 100% sure about the exact statistics but my best guess would be that more than 200-300 colleges and universities have been established in the last few years. We had only 4-5 engineering university back in 2000 but we have more than 30 such educational institutions now. More importance has been given to vocational education and thus a large number of underprivileged populations have come under the vocational education system.</p> <p>In a nutshell, that was a massive change and I have witnessed some of those changes in my own eyes including how public exams&rsquo; quality have been improved, how the schools are emphasising on English and Mathematics as academic subjects and so on and on.</p> <p>  </p>\n<p>Q. What changes do you foresee in the next 50 years?</p>\n<p>A. If you ask me about the type of changes that might occur in the education sector in my country in next 50 years, I would need to rely on my own past experience and predictions mostly. My best guess is that the education would be more practical than theoretical in future. Women&rsquo;s participation and performance in education would excel to a great extent. More women would be in research and higher education than their male counterpart.</p> <p>The education would be expensive and private education institutes would be more demanding than the public and state-owned ones. More foreign students would come to study here and the number of higher education institutes would increase by many-fold than the current number.</p> <p>The digitalization and computer-based education system would replace many traditional education systems and the online education would be a very popular form during that time.</p> <p>Curriculum and subject offered in the college and education level would see a dramatic increase and technology would be the most important and demanding subject in this era.</p> <p>Not sure if I will be alive or not to see the changes but I hope many positive changes within the next 50 years in my country including 100% literacy rate, more engineering and research-based education system, some of our universities are raking in the world&rsquo;s best university list and we are renowned as a country of a very excellent place for education.</p> <p>  </p>\n<p>A national education system...</p> <p>Q. How do the expectations of today&rsquo;s school leavers compare with those of the previous generation?</p>\n<p>A. Well, the school quitters nowadays are expected to study further and get involved in a part-time job to gain practical experience. The job market is pretty competitive compared to the previous time. Getting a good job requires talent, some practical experience, good grades in school and many other criteria. The competitions in public service or Government jobs are even higher. In the past decades there were very few school graduates in my country and hence securing a job both in public and private sector was not that tough.</p> <p>The requirement is education is higher than the past. Twelve class degree is not enough to get a decent job. Recruiters are looking for candidates with prior job experiences and at least Bachelor degree. Thus the school leavers nowadays have no other option but to continue their studies. Getting a part-time job besides the study is a dream for many.</p> <p>I heard from my grandfather that there were only few bachelor degree holders in his whole village while there must be more than 100 bachelor degree holders in a single community these days.</p> <p>Those who leave school without completing the course have no other option but to either look after their family business or manage a job where physical labour is the only skill that s/he has.</p> <p>The population in my country has almost doubled in the last decade and that is pretty obvious that the completion the school leavers nowadays face is tremendous. Among the school leavers, many decide their major in college or university while other prefers vocational education. This facility was very narrow in my grandfather&rsquo;s generation as I know. So I would say there is a whole lot of difference between current and past generations in terms of their opportunity, action and plan after leaving school.</p> <p>Q. What role do you think extracurricular activities play in education?</p>\n<p>A. Extracurricular activities sharpen the minds of students and enhance their creativity. Activities that require physical movements keep their body fit and thus the importance of extracurricular activities are immense. It is often experienced that kids who have interests in sports and games outperform the others in many fields. Extracurricular activities like singing, debating, painting can be very handy in terms of career enhancement. Students who have extracurricular activities possess better leadership and social activities. Finally from my experience, I can say that such students have better knowledge about the world than students who are solely focused on academic lessons.</p> <p>  </p>\n<p>Different styles/ methods of teaching and learning...</p> <p>Q. What method of learning works best for you?</p>\n<p>A. I prefer to work in a pair for the complex topics and subjects. The group discussion, in particular, works best for me. When I study in a group I can discuss my views and learn opinions of others. Thus the discussion is always helpful and I can better perform in an exam and remember the details for a long.</p> <p>Q. How beneficial do you think it is to group students according to their level of ability?</p>\n<p>A. It&rsquo;s always beneficial for students to make a group for study and discussion. If the group comprises students of similar calibre and talent levels, they are proven to be more helpful. Similar abilities of students in a group can be advantageous from mainly two points of views. They are more frank to participate in any discussion and they have a good understanding among themselves. Secondly, they understand each other better and can advise in an effective way.</p>",

        "content": "<p>This post will help you give better answers in part 2 of the IELTS speaking test.</p> <p>In IELTS speaking part 2 you will be given a topic or cue card similar to this:</p> <p>Describe a plant grown in your country. You should say</p>\n<p>&ndash; what the plant is</p>\n<p>&ndash; where it is grown</p>\n<p>&ndash; why you like or dislike it</p>\n<p>and explain why it is important to your country.</p>\n<p>You will have 1 minute to make notes and then will be asked to speak for between 1-2 minutes.</p> <p>Speaking for 2 minutes on an unfamiliar topic scares most IELTS students and that&rsquo;s why IELTS speaking part 2 is one of the most feared parts of the exam. The problem seems to be running out of things to say or not knowing what to say because you are unfamiliar with the cue card suggestions.</p> <p>To overcome this problem, I have developed a strategy to help students and it has proved very successful.</p> <p>A common error is thinking you have to talk about exactly what is written on the card. You don&rsquo;t! Having spoken to several IELTS examiners and students who achieved very high marks in their speaking test, I can assure you that you don&rsquo;t have to cover everything on the card. The band descriptors also don&rsquo;t mention anything about answering all the suggested parts of task 2.</p> <p>Following the suggested sentences on the card is fine and many candidates do very well following them but others run out of ideas. More importantly, if you have a structure to follow for every question you can practice and prepare more effectively.</p> <p>My strategy is to talk about what you feel comfortable talking about. In other words, talk about the things you think will get you the highest marks. If you like the suggestions on the card, then talk about them. But if you don&rsquo;t, or you want some extra things to talk about, then follow the strategy below.</p> <p>When you get the cue card you will be given one minute to write down some ideas. You are going to use this time wisely by using the following structure. On the piece of paper provided write down five headings with a little space between each one.</p> <p>Introduction</p>\n<p>Past</p>\n<p>Description</p>\n<p>Opinion</p>\n<p>Future</p> <p>Now you will start to write keywords beside each of these headings. Let&rsquo;s look at each in a little more detail.</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>Start off by saying &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to talk about (X).&rsquo; Then say &lsquo;I chose this topic because&hellip;&rsquo; and you will be able to say why you choose this topic. If you can&rsquo;t think of a reason just make one up, although it&rsquo;s always better to talk about real experiences.</p> <p>Past</p> <p>Now pause and use a linking word like &lsquo;anyway&rsquo; or &lsquo;anyhow&rsquo; to transition into talking about the past. This will allow you to demonstrate that you are confident using a range of past structures. For example-</p> <p>Used to + infinitive to talk about past habits or states that are now finished.</p>\n<p>Would + infinitive to describe past habits.</p>\n<p>Past simple to talk about things you did in the past that you no longer do or are no longer true.</p>\n<p>Past continuous to talk about the background of a story or how you felt at a particular time.</p>\n<p>Past perfect to say something happened before something else in the past.</p> <p>Description</p> <p>Now pause and say &lsquo;So let me tell you about (X) in a little more detail.&rsquo; This is your opportunity to impress the examiner with specific vocabulary. Get to know the common topics and have some specific adjectives ready. If you use an adjective to describe something, make sure you expand on it or explain it with examples. Again, if you can&rsquo;t think of specific examples, it is fine to make these up. Make sure your examples match the adjective and you will be fine.</p> <p>Opinion</p> <p>Now you can pause and say &lsquo;If you ask me/In my view/I would say + (opinion on topic). This give you a chance to express how you feel about the topic. It could be your personal opinion or it could be a comparative or superlative. Using a wide range of phrases to express your opinion will help you get a higher mark. If you want to give a stronger opinion you could say:</p> <p>I strongly believe that&hellip;</p>\n<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned&hellip;</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m strongly against&hellip;</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m strongly in favour of&hellip;.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical of the idea that&hellip;</p>\n<p>I must admit, I think&hellip;.</p> <p>Future</p> <p>Finally you can display your ability to use future tenses. Start off by saying &lsquo;With regards to the future&hellip;.&rsquo; A range of tenses will help you gain extra marks. For example you could use:</p> <p>Present continuous to talk about fixed arrangements.</p>\n<p>Be going + to + infinitive to talk about future plans.</p>\n<p>Will or won&rsquo;t + infinitive is used with predictions based on opinions or experiences. It can also be used to talk about hopes and assumptions.</p>\n<p>The future perfect- will have + past participle- is used to say something will have happened or will have been completed by a certain point in the future.</p> <p>That&rsquo;s it! Five simple headings that will allow you to speak for at least two minutes without any difficultly.</p>",

        "content": "<h5>Skimming and Scanning Practice</h5>\n<p>Now it's time for practice. Like on a real IELTS Reading test, you have to read the text and answer the questions below.</p>\n<p>First of all, let's practise  <strong>skimming</strong>. When reading a text for the first time, you should skim over it to  <strong>grasp the main idea</strong>. In this example,  <em>read the  <span style=\"background-color: #ffff99;\">highlighted</span> text  and quickly look over the rest of the text</em>  (you have about 1-2 minutes):</p>\n \n<div class=\"exam-text\">\n<div class=\"exam-text\">\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\" align=\"center\">Are electric cars really eco-friendly?</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fffacd;\">Electric-car drivers are saving the planet, right? Their vehicles produce none of the pollutants that dinosaur-burning, fossil-fuel-powered machines do. That is the standard view, and governments around the world provide incentives to encourage the uptake of this new technology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fffacd;\">That is why a Tesla owner got a rude shock when he went to import his vehicle into Singapore - the first person to do so.</span> The Tesla Model S is a 100% electric vehicle. It does not have an exhaust to emit from. So what happened?</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fffacd;\">Instead of an expected rebate of around S$15,000 (US$10,800) he received a fine of the same amount for being a gross polluter.</span> The company commented the incident, \"The Model S that our customer imported into Singapore left our factory only two years ago with energy consumption rated at 181 Wh/km. This qualifies as the cleanest possible category of car in Singapore and entitles the owner to an incentive rather than a fine.\"</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fffacd;\">The Singapore authorities calculated the &lsquo;carbon cost&rsquo; of generating the electricity that will be used to charge the car.</span> This is the elephant in the trunk of electric vehicles. Where and how the power is produced is not often considered, but perhaps it should be. Let&rsquo;s move the elephant up to the passenger seat and address it directly.</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fffacd;\">The authorities in Singapore apparently found the Tesla in question consumes 444 watt-hours of electricity per km (Wh/km) in tests.</span> Without wanting to get too maths-heavy, the number of <span style=\"background-color: #fffacd;\">444Wh/km does seem high</span>. And as we still need power stations to produce such amount electric energy, the environmental impact is not so small as it seemed to be.</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fffacd;\">But what about the bigger picture - should we be factoring in the emissions of power stations when working out how green an electric car is? The logical answer is yes. Emissions shifted elsewhere are still emissions, and CO2 impacts the global atmosphere wherever it is released.</span></p>\n</div>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at the questions:</p>\n<p>1. What is the aim of this text?</p>\n<ol type=\"A\">\n<li>To discourage people from visiting Singapore</li>\n<li>To prove that electric cars are less eco-friendly than fossil-fuel-powered machines</li>\n<li>To show that we need to count the emissions of power stations to see how green an electric car is.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This question can be answered immediately after you  <strong>skimmed over</strong>  the text. Here, you&rsquo;re required to understand only the main idea of the passage.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the  <strong>correct answer is C</strong>. It&rsquo;s also stated in the last paragraph:</p>\n<p class=\"text-extract\">But what about the bigger picture - should we be  <u>factoring in the emissions of power stations when working out how green an electric car is</u>? The logical answer is  <u>yes</u>.</p>\n \n<p>2. When the owner of the electric car went to Singapore, he received</p>\n<ol type=\"A\">\n<li>a rebate of around US$10,800</li>\n<li>a fine of around US$10,800</li>\n<li>a fine of around US$15,000</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And this question, unlike the previous one, requires specific detail: amount of money. To answer it, you should  <strong>scan the text for words $10,800 and $15,000</strong>. Don&rsquo;t read the text again! Just search these two key words. Once you have found the right sentence, read it attentively to get the answer.</p>\n<p>The sentence that contains these key words is in the third paragraph:</p>\n<p class=\"text-extract\">Instead of an expected rebate of around  <u>S$15,000</u>  (<u>US$10,800</u>) he received a fine of the same amount for being a gross polluter.</p> <p>Now it&rsquo;s clear to us that the  <strong>correct answer is B</strong>.</p>\n \n<p>3. To prove that electric car was a gross polluter, the authorities in Singapore calculated the ...................... of generating the electricity to charge the car.</p>\n \n<p>After you skimmed over the article, you should know that the  <u>Singapore authorities</u>  and  <u>charging car</u>  were mentioned somewhere in the middle of the text. Moreover, you have another clue:  <em>the answer should be after the answer to the question 3</em>. You can find the right answer by these key words:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>authorities in Singapore</li>\n<li>electricity to charge the car</li>\n</ul> <p>If you  <strong>scan</strong>  the text for these key words, and you will find the answer in the fourth paragraph:</p>\n<p class=\"text-extract\">  The Singapore authorities calculated the &lsquo;carbon cost&rsquo; of generating the electricity that will be used to charge the car.</p> <p>The correct answer is  <strong>carbon cost</strong>.</p>\n</div>",

It seems that the changes do not refer to all offices.</p>\n<p>The word &lsquo;staff&rsquo; is in the first improvement listed. It says there are &lsquo;more staff at peak periods&rsquo;. This means that there are only more staff at the busiest times of the day and not all day. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.</p> <p>QUESTION 2</p>\n<p>+ Step 2: Read the question</p>\n<p>The key words are underlined:</p>\n<p>There will be special service windows for cash transactions at nil mam offices.</p>\n<p>You need to find information about special service windows, namely: their functions (are they used for cash transactions?) and where they are located (are they at all many offices?).</p> <p>+ Step 3: Find the answer</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Special service windows&rdquo; are mentioned in the third point, hut cash transactions are not mentioned. There is no information in the text about what kinds of transactions take place. Nor is there any information about whether these windows will be at nil main post offices. Therefore, the correct answer is NOT GIVEN.</p> <p>QUESTION 3</p>\n<p>+ Step 2: Read the question</p>\n<p>The key words are:</p>\n<p>It will be possible to obtain some items from machines.</p>\n<p>You should search the text for the word &lsquo;machines&rsquo; or synonyms.</p> <p>+ Step 3: Find the answer</p>\n<p>Point 6 mentions &lsquo;cash machines&rsquo; and &lsquo;phone card and stamp dispensers&rsquo;. So you can obtain (get) cash (one item) from a machine, but what are &lsquo;dispensers&rsquo;? The text tells you that they provide a faster service, and vending machines do that, so it is reasonable to guess that a dispenser is a kind of machine. So, you can get some items from machines. Therefore, the correct answer is TRUE.</p>\n<p>Note: If you don&rsquo;t know the meaning of a word, you may be able to work out its meaning by looking at the words around it. This technique is called guessing from context. It is a very important skill and will be discussed in detail at the end of Section 2.</p> <p>QUESTION 4</p>\n<p>+ Step 2: Read the instructions and the question</p>\n<p>Here you are instructed to write your answer in up to three words (i.e. one, two or three words).</p>\n<p>The key words in the question 4 are:</p>\n<p>Which chance will ensure that the customers are treated mote fairly?</p>\n<p>All of the changes mentioned in the text are to &lsquo;help improve the standard of service*. Which one provides fairer service?</p> <p>+ Step 3: Find the answer</p>\n<p>Point one provides &lsquo;faster service*. Point cwo provides &lsquo;fairer service*. You don&rsquo;t need to read further than this. The answer is &lsquo;single queuing system&rsquo; (3 words).</p> <p>QUESTION 5</p>\n<p>+ Step 2: Read the instructions and the question</p>\n<p>The instruction tells you to write a letter (A, B, C or D), not a word.</p>\n<p>The key words in the question are underlined:</p>\n<p>Which offices will stay open longer?</p>\n<p>Tire answer choices also help here. Factors such as the type of office (main or agency) and whether it is some or all offices are relevant.</p> <p>+ Step 3: Find the answer</p>\n<p>We have already looked for the key word &lsquo;office&rsquo; (in question 1) and found that the changes arc being introduced in &lsquo;our main offices&rsquo; (sentence 1) and &lsquo;many of our agency offices&rsquo;. It seems that the changes do not refer to all offices.</p>\n<p>Looking quickly for stay open longer or synonyms, we find &lsquo;extended opening hours&rsquo; in the seventh improvement. However, it mentions only &lsquo;selected main offices&rsquo;. The answer is therefore C&mdash;&lsquo;some main offices&rsquo;.</p> <p>Analysis and Practice</p>\n<p>The three different kinds of questions used in the demonstration are the most common question types in Section 1 of the Reading test.</p>\n<p>&bull; True-False-Not Given (questions 1-3)</p>\n<p>&bull; Short answer of no more than three words (question 4)</p>\n<p>&bull; Multiple choice (question 5)</p> <p>Following the three-step strategy:</p>\n<p>&bull; Survey the text</p>\n<p>&bull; Read the instructions and the question(s)</p>\n<p>&bull; Find the answers</p>\n<p>is usually the fastest and surest way of doing the kinds of questions you will find in Section 1. We will now look at each of these steps in more detail.</p> <p>Step 1&mdash;Survey the text</p>\n<p>You can quickly obtain a lot of useful information about a text by just looking at:</p>\n<p>&bull; the title</p>\n<p>&bull; section headings or subheadings</p>\n<p>&bull; any words in special print (bold, italics, CAPITALS or underlined)</p>\n<p>&bull; any diagrams, tables or pictures</p>\n<p>&bull; any unusual features of the text (e.g. layout or boxed text).</p> <p>Surveying cells you about the topic or subject of the text. It may also tell you something about how the text is organized (subheadings arc especially useful). Surveying may also tell you something about the writer&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;whether the intention is to give instructions, to compare, to give information, and so on.</p> <p>ACTIVITY 1</p>\n<p>In the following text you can see only the layout, the title, the subheadings, the illustration and a few words in special print above the illustration. These are the features of the text you look at when you survey. With only this information, answer the questions that follow the text.</p> <p>Time target: up to 2 minutes</p>\n<p>1. What is the text about?</p>\n<p>A. the heart</p>\n<p>B. smoking</p>\n<p>C. healthy habits</p>\n<p>D. heart attacks</p> <p>2. How many signs of a heart attack are described?</p> <p>3. Name two things that are not good for your heart.</p> <p>4. The semi-recumbent position is dangerous for someone who has had a heart attack. Is this statement TRUE, FALSE or is the information NOT GIVEN?</p> <p>Check your answers with the Answer Key.</p>\n<p>The next activity gives you a complete text, but do not read the complete text in the normal way. You should be able to answer the questions below the text by only surveying the text.</p> <p>ACTIVITY 2</p>\n<p>Survey the following text and then answer the questions using the strategy described in the Demonstration.</p>\n<p>Time target: 2 minutes</p>\n<p>If you travel by bus, car, boat, plane or train with your children, make sure that travel-sickness doesn&rsquo;t spoil the journey.</p>\n<p>Take a of packet of EASY RIDERS.</p>\n<p>Easy Riders arc chocolate flavoured but they aren&rsquo;t lollies. They&rsquo;re children&rsquo;s travel-sickness tablets.</p>\n<p>The tablets contain doses that are safe for children, so there&rsquo;s no danger of overdose if you follow the instructions on the packet.</p>\n<p>You can give EASY RIDERS to your children as a preventative measure or wait to see if travel-sickness develops and then give one.</p>\n<p>So if you&rsquo;re taking your children on a journey, don&rsquo;t forget the EASY RIDERS.</p>\n<p>An easy ride for your children means an easier ride for you. Available from your local chemist or drugstore.</p>\n<p>Produced by</p>\n<p>LUCKY PHARMACEUTICAL CO.</p> <p>Questions 1-3</p>\n<p>1. Easy Riders are:</p>\n<p>A. a kind of game</p>\n<p>B. a travel company</p>\n<p>C. a kind of medicine</p>\n<p>D. special bus tickets</p> <p>2. Name one place where you can buy Easy Riders?</p> <p>3. Who are Easy Riders for?</p> <p>Check your answers with the Answer Key.</p>\n<p>Step 2&mdash;Read the instructions and the question</p>\n<p>Reading the instructions</p>\n<p>It is very important that you read the instructions carefully. If you do not follow the instructions and write your answer the wrong way&mdash;for example, if the instructions tell you to write a letter (A, B, C) and you write a word&mdash; your answer may be marked incorrect.</p> <p>ACTIVITY 3</p>\n<p>Here are some questions about the first part of this book. The questions are followed by a candidate&rsquo;s sample answers. Is the information in each answer correct? Try to check the answer by scanning earlier pacts of this book. Also, check that the questions have been answered in the correct way. If not, what is wrong with them?</p>\n<p>Questions 1-3: Using NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS, answer the following questions.</p>\n<p>1. Who published this book? Oxford University Press</p>\n<p>2. Where must the candidates write their answers in the IELTS Reading test? On the official answer sheet</p>\n<p>3. Name one thing a reader can learn about a text by surveying it.</p>\n<p>The topic, organization and writer&rsquo;s purpose</p> <p>Questions 4-6: Read the statements below. Write:</p>\n<p>TRUE if the statement is true</p>\n<p>FALSE if the statement is false</p>\n<p>NOT GIVEN if there is no information about this in the text</p>\n<p>4. The first section of the Reading test has longer texts than the other sections in the test. False</p> <p>5. Candidates should read instructions carefully before writing their answers. True</p> <p>6. Most IELTS Reading texts come from British publications. No information</p> <p>Questions 7: Answer the questions by choosing the appropriate letters A-D.</p>\n<p>7. If the instruction says &lsquo;USING NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS&rsquo;, how many words should you write? one, two or three</p>\n<p>A. more than three</p>\n<p>B. exactly three</p>\n<p>C. one, two or three</p>\n<p>D. less than three</p> <p>8. Which of the following do you NOT do when surveying a text? B</p>\n<p>A. read the title</p>\n<p>B. read most of the words in the text carefully</p>\n<p>C. look at illustrations and diagrams</p>\n<p>D. read section headings and/or subheadings</p> <p>Check your answers with the Answer Key.</p>\n<p>In the real IELTS Test, it is also essential that you write your answer in the correct box on the answer sheet. You should keep checking that you are writing every answer in the box that has the same number as the question. You will have a chance to practice this when you do the Practice tests at the end of this book.</p>\n<p>Reading the question You should try to identify:</p>\n<p>&bull; the topic (the subject, or what the question is about)</p>\n<p>&bull; exactly what you need to know about the topic.</p> <p>It is a good idea to underline the key words in the question as you read. (Remember that you can write on the question booklet.) Look back at the Demonstration answers for Reading Sample 1 to see how you should do this. For multiple choice questions you may have to underline key words in tire answer choices as weU as in the question.</p> <p>Step 3&mdash;Looking for the answers</p>\n<p>In exams you do not have time to read every word carefully. Remember that your task is to answer the questions, not to understand all of the text. It is often only necessary to read a small part of the text carefully to answer the questions.</p>\n<p>The best way to find details quickly is to use scanning. Scanning is searching for key words or synonyms by looking quickly through the text. Your eyes move across and down through the text without reading in the normal way. For example, you scan when you look for a word in a dictionary. You do not read every word as you search for the word(s) you want.</p>\n<p>It is easiest to scan for numbers or words which start with capital letters (such as most names) because these stand out in a text.</p> <p>ACTIVITY 4</p>\n<p>Answer the questions that follow the next text by scanning. Use the names and numbers to find the answers to the questions.</p> <p>Time target: 3 minutes</p> <p>SOURCES OF VITAMINS</p>\n<p>Most vitamins we need are available in sufficient quantities in vegetables and fruits. To give some examples, we need about 50mg of vitamin C per day. and we can get it readily from citrus fruits, tomatoes and green vegetables. Vitamin A (800mg per day) is also available mainly from green vegetables.</p>\n<p>Some vitamins, however, can only be found in sufficient quantities in animal products. For example, vitamin B12, of which we need about 2mg per day for healthy red blood cells, is usually obtained from liver, sardines and eggs. The 15mg of niacin we need is most readily obtained from lean meats and fish.</p>\n<p>Vitamin D is unusual in that it is usually produced by our own bodies after receiving sunlight on our skin. The growth and development of bones and teeth relies partly on us having 10mg of vitamin D per day.</p> <p>1. What is one source of Vitamin A?</p>\n<p>2. We need 15mg per day of which vitamin?</p>\n<p>3. We need 2mg per day of which vitamin?</p>\n<p>4. How much Vitamin D should we have per day?</p>\n<p>Check your answers with the Answer Key.</p> <p>Scanning for normal words is a bit more difficult than scanning for numbers or names, but if you practise you will be able to do it more quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>ACTIVITY 5</p>\n<p>Go back to the text &lsquo;Easy Riders&rsquo; extract. Answer the following question by scanning only.</p>\n<p>1. How many times is the word &lsquo;children&rsquo; mentioned in the text?</p>\n<p>Time target: 20 seconds</p> <p>Check your answer in the Answer Key.</p> <p>ACTIVITY 6</p>\n<p>Now try to answer some IELTS-type questions about the &lsquo;Easy Riders&rsquo; text First, survey the text (Step 1) again. Read the instructions and the question (Step 2). Decide which words from the following questions are key words and then scan for those key words or their synonyms to find the answer (Step 3).</p> <p>Time target: 2 minutes</p> <p>Questions 1-3: Do the following statements agree with the information given in the Reading text?</p>\n<p>Write:</p>\n<p>TRUE if the statement is true</p>\n<p>FALSE if the statement is false</p>\n<p>NOT GIVEN if the information is not given in the text</p>\n<p>1. Easy Riders can be used for land, sea or air travel.</p>\n<p>2. Easy Riders are chocolates.</p>\n<p>3. An overdose of this medicine is not dangerous.</p> <p>Question 4: Choose the correct answer by writing A, B, C or D.</p>\n<p>4. When should you give Easy Riders to children?</p>\n<p>A. only before the journey begins</p>\n<p>B. only when the child is sick</p>\n<p>C. both one before the journey starts and another during the journey if there are symptoms of travel sickness</p>\n<p>D. either one before the journey begins or one during the journey if there are symptoms of travel sickness</p>\n<p>Check your answers with the Answer Key.</p> <p>ACTIVITY 7</p>\n<p>In this activity we will again practice scanning for synonyms. The complete &lsquo;Heart Attacks&rsquo; text follows. Do not read the text in the normal way. Look at the underlined words and phrases below and scan for their synonyms in the text.</p>\n<p>Time target: 3 minutes</p>\n<p>1. The person who has had the heart attack may not be conscious.</p>\n<p>2. Check the heart rate and breathing.</p>\n<p>3. Try to lose weight.</p>\n<p>4. Victims of heart attacks have difficulty breathing.</p>\n<p>5. Pain may begin suddenly in the centre of the chest.</p>\n<p>6. The person should sit in a way that does not put too much pressure on the chest.</p> <p>Check your answers in the Answer Key.</p> <p>HEART ATTACK</p>\n<p>A heart attack is caused by a reduction in the blood supply to the heart muscles. This is most commonly caused by a blood clot obstructing an artery in the heart. Heart attacks can be mild or severe. If you suspect that someone has had a heart attack call for medical help immediately.</p> <p>Signs of a heart attack</p>\n<p>&bull; Sudden onset of pain in the centre of the chest. The pain will be vice-like, crushing. It could be confused with very severe indigestion. It may spread upwards and outwards to the throat, jaw and arms.</p>\n<p>&bull; Shortness of breath.</p>\n<p>&bull; The pulse rate may become faster or weak and irregular.</p>\n<p>&bull; The casualty will become pale and sweaty and show signs of shock (page 39).</p> <p>Action to take</p>\n<p>Call an ambulance. Check the heartbeat and breathing. If it has stopped, then commence external chest compression and mouth-to-mouth ventilation immediately.</p>\n<p>If the casualty is conscious, move gently and as little as possible into a comfortable position. A semi-recumbent position (shown below) is the best. It is easiest for the casualty to breathe in this position and takes some of the strain off the heart.</p>\n<p>Loosen any clothing around the neck and reassure that help is on its way. Monitor heart rate and breathing regularly until help arrives. If the person becomes unconscious move to the recovery position.</p> <p>Preventing a heart attack</p>\n<p>+ Stop smoking</p>\n<p>Smoking is the major cause of heart disease. It damages the arteries and the circulation of blood. Stop immediately.</p> <p>+ Take regular exercise</p>\n<p>Steady and regular exercise is very beneficial. Walking is a good form of exercise.</p> <p>+ Check your blood pressure</p>\n<p>High blood pressure can cause a heart attack. Ask your doctor to check your blood pressure.</p> <p>+ Eat a sensible diet</p>\n<p>Cut down on the amount of fatty foods that you eat. Cut fat off meat.</p> <p>+ Keep your weight down</p>\n<p>If you are overweight, this puts an extra strain on the heart. Shed those excess pounds now!</p> <p>+ Avoid unnecessary stress</p>\n<p>Do not push yourself to unrealistic targets. Be sensible about the amount of work you do each day.</p> <p>Put the patient in a semi-recumbent position</p> <p>ACTIVITY 8</p> <p>Now try to do some IELTS-type questions about the &lsquo;Heart Attacks&rsquo; text. First, survey the text quickly again (Step I). Read the instructions and the question (Step 2) and then finally scan for the answer (Step 3).</p>\n<p>Time target: 5 minutes</p>\n<p>Questions 1-2: Choose the appropriate letters A-D.</p>\n<p>1. What causes a heart attack?</p>\n<p>A. too much blood getting to the heart muscle</p>\n<p>B. not enough blood getting to the heart muscle</p>\n<p>C. an artery in the heart</p>\n<p>D. an obstructed heart muscle</p> <p>2. Which of the following is not a sign of a heart attack?</p>\n<p>A. pain in the centre of the chest</p>\n<p>B. indigestion</p>\n<p>C. breathing difficulties</p>\n<p>D. fast or weak and irregular pulse rate</p> <p>Questions 3-4: Complete the sentences below with words token from the reading passage.

        "content": "<p>The IELTS General Training Reading test takes 60 minutes. It is divided into three sections.</p>\n<p>&diams; <strong>Section 1</strong>: has short texts which come from advertisements, timetables, instruction manuals and the like.</p>\n<p>&diams; <strong>Section 2</strong>: has longer texts (usually two texts of about 500 words each) which give information and advice about education and training.</p>\n<p>&diams; <strong>Section 3</strong>: has one longer text (about 700 words) with more complex language and structure. The text will be about a general topic and will come from sources like general interest magazines.</p> <p>There are between 38 and 42 questions to answer. The questions may come before or after the reading texts. There is a variety of questions. Often there are examples of how to answer the questions.</p>\n<p>You may mark or write on the question paper, but all answers must be written on the answer sheet.</p>\n<p>+ <strong>Step 1</strong>: Survey the text</p>\n<p>+ <strong>Step 2</strong>: Skim the text to identify its organization</p>\n<p>+ <strong>Step 3</strong>: Read the question</p>\n<p>+ <strong>Step 4</strong>: Skim or scan for the answer</p> <p>In this section there is only one longer reading text (about 700 words), usually without subheadings. There will be three or four different types of questions. The question-types could be:</p>\n<p>&bull; any of those from Sections 1 or 2</p>\n<p>&bull; completing a summary</p>\n<p>&bull; completing a table</p>\n<p>&bull; identifying qualities or characteristics.</p> <p>Because the text is quite long, and because you will be looking for different kinds of information, it is a good idea to first survey the text to identify the topic, and then skim the text to identify how the information is organised before you start answering the questions.</p>\n<p>As with Section 2 of the test, the skills of scanning and skimming are very important in this section. You must use your time efficiently. The following Demonstration section will show you how to answer die questions widiout wasting time. Skills and strategies will be discussed in the Analysis and Practice section which follows the Demonstration.</p>\n<p>Do not read the demonstration text and questions first. Go directly to the How to Answer section on page 47, and refer back to the reading text as instructed.</p> <p>Demonstration &mdash; Text and Questions</p> <p>Questions 1-4: The passage has 8 paragraphs labelled A-H.</p>\n<p>Which paragraphs contain the following information?</p>\n<p>Write the appropriate letters A-H in boxes 1-4 on your answer sheet.</p>\n<p>You only need ONE letter for each answer.</p>\n<p>Note: You may use each letter more than once.</p>\n<p>Example Answer: Numbers living in cities between 1950 and 1985. A</p>\n<p>1. The number of large cities in Africa.</p>\n<p>2. The projected population of Mexico City.</p>\n<p>3. An explanation of what &lsquo;natural&rsquo; population increase is.</p>\n<p>4. The lack of clean water in cities.</p> <p><strong>URBANISATION</strong></p>\n<p>A. The United Nations Human Development Report 1990 has called this &ldquo;the century of the great urban explosion&rdquo;. Between 1950 and 1985 the number of people living in cities m the world nearly tripled. In the developing world, it quadrupled&mdash;from less than 300 million to about 12 billion. In Africa, the: population of the larger increased more than sevenfold over this period.</p>\n<p>B. Although the rate of city growth is expected to slow in the future, the absolute numbers added each year will continue to grow. Most of this growth is much as two-thirds in many Asian and Latin American cities&mdash; will come from natural increase (ex: the excess of births over deaths) of populations already in cities. The rest will come from rural-urban migration i pan a result of high rural fertility putting pressure on agricultural livelihood and the urbanization of currently rural areas.</p>\n<p>C. In future, the urban population of the developing countries is expected to grow by nearly another billion in the next fifteen years. By 2015, half die developing world&rsquo;s people will live in urban areas. Growth rates will be fastest in Africa, though absolute growth will be greatest in Asia, where cities will gain 500 million inhabitants between 1985 and the turn of the century.</p>\n<p>D. An increasing proportion of the urbanized population will be living in huge cities. The number of cities with a million or more inhabit i in developing countries was only 28 in 1950. By 1989 there were 125, and there will be a projected 277 in the year 2000. Africa had only city in 1951 . By 2000 Africa could have 60 cities of a million or more.</p>\n<p>E. However, urban growth in developing countries has not been evenly distributed between all cities. In most one or two giant cities have grown out of all proportion, cornering the lion&rsquo;s share of investment industry and government spending&mdash;but also creating problems of congestion, squalor and unrest.</p>\n<p>F. In 1970, only 13 per cent of the urban population of developing countries lived in cities with more than four million people. By 2025, such cities are expected to house 28 per cent of town dwellers. While many northern cities such as London or Paris have leveled out or reduced their population. The dominant cities of developing countries have grown exponentially. The populations of Tehran, Karachi and Manila grew at 5 per cent or more a year in the 1970s, and those of Delhi, Mexico City, Seoul, Sao Paolo and Jakarta at between 4 or 5 percent. A number of cities may grow to gigantic size. Mexico City, which had a population of 15 million in 1980, may grow to nearly 25 million by the year 2000. Greater Bombay, which had only 3 million inhabitants in 1950, is expected to be the second largest with over 15 million. Jakarta will be third, with an estimated 13 million or more inhabitants by the turn of the century.</p>\n<p>G. While the balanced, gradual growth of cities of half a million or less is rarely a problem, rapid urbanization, especially in poor countries, nearly always is. The growth of urban populations has regularly outpaced the growth of paying jobs and of government resources for infrastructure and services, such as sewerage and water supply. Large proportions of urban dwellers live in illegal, self-built housing without secure tenure or facilities. An estimated 40 per cent live in such conditions in Nairobi, Lima and Manila, and around 60 per cent in Delhi and El Salvador. One city dweller in three had no access to clean water in 1983 and two our of three had no proper sanitation. Some make their homes &ndash; and their livings &ndash; on rubbish dumps.</p>\n<p>H. In dealing with problems like this, attention must be focused not only on cities. City dwellers do need cheap land and building materials, secure tenure and local employment. More attention also needs to be given to reversing appalling urban environmental deterioration. But improving conditions in rural areas will also help. People in country areas would then have much less incentive to migrate to cities. Any measure that leads to a slowing down in the rate of urban population growth will contribute to an improvement of living conditions there.</p> <p>Questions 5-9: Complete the table below using A NUMBER, OR NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS.

There are two main ways of addressing these problems. The first is to improve conditions in cities, for example by providing cheaper, more secure housing and improving urban (11) &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. The second is to spend more money on (12) &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. development, thereby (13) &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; the rates of migration from rural to urban areas.</p>\n<p>Developing countries Growing</p>\n<p>Reducing Increase</p>\n<p>cities Housing</p>\n<p>environments Rural</p>\n<p>Problem Expensive</p>\n<p>Urban</p> <p><strong>How to Answer</strong></p>\n<p>In this section, we show you how to answer only some of the Demonstration questions. At the end of Section 3 we will ask you to answer the remaining questions, using the skills and strategies that you learn and practice in the following pages.</p> <p><strong>Step 1&mdash;Survey the text</strong></p>\n<p>The title of the extract, &lsquo;Urbanization&rsquo;, tells you (if you know the word) that the text is about the growth or development of cities. There arc 8 paragraphs labelled A-H. No other information is available from quickly surveying the text, so to find out about what aspect of urbanization is discussed in the text, you will have to go on to step 2.</p> <p><strong>Step 2&mdash;Skim the text to identify its organization</strong></p>\n<p>Paragraph A introduces the idea of cities growing fast, especially in developing countries.</p>\n<p>Paragraph B deals with the future growth of cities. By reading only those words in black print in the remainder of the paragraph we see that reasons are given for this growth.</p>\n<p>Paragraph C gives some details of the size of future growth. If you read only the words in black print in the rest of the paragraph, you can see that the paragraph goes on to talk about the &lsquo;fastest&rsquo; growth, in Africa and Asia.</p>\n<p>Paragraph D mentions &lsquo;huge cities&rsquo;. The rest of the paragraph gives details about the past and future growth of very big cities.</p>\n<p>Paragraph E introduces the idea of uneven growth of cities in developing countries. The rest of the paragraph talks about the problems of the &lsquo;giant&rsquo; cities.</p>\n<p>Paragraph F introduces the topic of cities which have a population of over 4 million. The rest of the paragraph lists some of these &lsquo;giant&rsquo; cities and gives details of their size and growth rates.</p>\n<p>Paragraph G touches on the problems of these very large cities in poor countries. The paragraph continues to give examples of some of the problems.</p>\n<p>Paragraph H starts to talk about solutions to the problems mentioned earlier in the text. The remainder of the paragraph states what these solutions are.</p>\n<p>From skimming the text we know how the text is organized. The organization of the text can be summarized as follows:</p> <p>Question 1</p> <p><strong>Step 3&mdash;Read the question</strong></p>\n<p>You are looking for the location of pieces of specific information. You have to indicate the location by choosing only one paragraph. (Notice that the key words in the sentence are underlined.)</p>\n<p>The number of large cities in Africa.</p> <p>Step 4&mdash;Look for the answer</p>\n<p>From your knowledge of the organization of the text, you can guess that this information might be in paragraphs A, C or D.</p>\n<p>Scanning for the key word &lsquo;Africa&rsquo;, you see that the sentence with this word in paragraph A says nothing about numbers of cities. The same is true of paragraph C. In paragraph D, the last two sentences mention &lsquo;Africa&rsquo;. Here the text gives numbers of cities, so D is the correct answer.</p> <p>Question 2</p>\n<p>Step 3&mdash;Read the question The projected population of Mexico in the year 2009.</p>\n<p>Step 4&mdash;Find the answer</p>\n<p>It is difficult to predict the location of this information. Paragraphs A, C, D or F could give details of the population of a large city like Mexico. However, it will be relatively easy to scan for the name of the city.</p>\n<p>Mexico City is mentioned twice in paragraph F. The second time gives the predicted future population&mdash;F is the correct answer.</p> <p>Questions 3 and 4</p>\n<p>These questions are not answered here. At the end of Section 3 you will be asked to answer them, using the skills and strategies that you will learn later in this section.</p> <p>Question 5</p>\n<p>Step 3&mdash;Read the question</p>\n<p>The instructions tell you to fill in the numbered gaps in the table with a number or one, two or three (but no more) words.</p>\n<p>Before trying to answer questions 5-9, it is important to be able to read the table. Move your eyes across the tabic to get an idea of how it is organised. There are three types of information included: when, where and wfiat. To see what kind of answer is needed for question 5, read across the table: where? &lsquo;in developing countries&rsquo;; what? &lsquo;half the population will be living in cities&rsquo;. The missing information is the answer to the question when?</p>\n<p>Changing the gap in the table to a question you get:</p>\n<p>When will half of the populations of developing countries be living in cities?</p>\n<p>The word &lsquo;will&rsquo; indicates that you must look for a time (a year) in the future. Step 4&mdash;Find the answer</p>\n<p>From the Initial skim reading of the text, you can guess that this information will be in either paragraphs A, C, or D.</p>\n<p>By scanning paragraph A you will not find a future time reference. Paragraph C mentions the year 2015 in the second half of the first sentence. Reading this sentence confirms that it talks about the specific information mentioned in the question&mdash;2015 is the correct answer.</p> <p>Question 6</p>\n<p>Step 3&mdash;Read the question</p>\n<p>Use the information in the where and what columns to clarify the question:</p>\n<p>Where did the number of people living in cities increase by about 3 tunes between 1950 and 1985?</p> <p>Step 4&mdash;Find the answer</p>\n<p>This information could be in paragraphs A, D or F. Scanning for the years 1950 and 1985&mdash;numbers are always easier to scan for than words&mdash;in paragraph A, you find both of them in the second half of the first sentence. Three statistics arc given for this time period, regarding the number of people living in cities.</p>\n<p>1. &rdquo; &hellip;&hellip;. in the world nearly tripled&rdquo; (tripled = 3 times)</p>\n<p>2. &ldquo;In the developing world &hellip; quadrupled&rdquo; (quadrupled &ndash; four times)</p>\n<p>3. &ldquo;In Africa (larger cities) &hellip; increased more than sevenfold&rdquo; (sevenfold = 7 times)</p> <p>So the correct answer is the world. (If you did not know what the word &lsquo;tripled&rsquo; means, the word &lsquo;nearly&rsquo; could help you to choose the correct answer. In this context, &lsquo;nearly&rsquo; has a similar meaning to the word which is used in the question, &lsquo;about&rsquo;.</p> <p>Questions 7-9</p>\n<p>These questions arc not answered here. At the end of Section 3 you will be asked to answer them, using the skills and strategies that you learn later.</p> <p>Questions 10-13</p> <p>Step 3&mdash;Read rite question</p>\n<p>You are instructed to complete the summary of part of the text by choosing words from the box. But which part of the text does it summarise? Briefly skim the whole summary. The first half of the summary talks about the problems of utban growth, and the second half talks about rite solutions. You already know that paragraph G deals with the problems, and that paragraph H deals with the solutions, so it is reasonably clear that the summary deals with the last two paragraphs of the text.</p> <p>Question 10</p>\n<p>Step 3&mdash;Read the question</p>\n<p>Many people living in (10)&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. have inadequate housing without sanitation or clean water supplies.</p> <p>Step 4&mdash;Find the answer</p>\n<p>Looking at the first sentence you can see that you need a noun to fill the gap. If you scan the words in the box you can eliminate the words reducing, urban, rural, growing and expensive. Scanning paragraph G for &lsquo;inadequate housing* or synonyms, you find &lsquo;live in illegal, self-built housing without secure tenure or facilities&rsquo;. The subject of the verb live is &lsquo;large proportions of urban dwellers&rsquo;, so you are looking for a word which means &lsquo;urban&rsquo; but is a noun. Look at the box again and you will find the word cities. This is the correct answer.</p> <p>Question 11</p>\n<p>Step 3&mdash;Read the question</p>\n<p>The first is to improve conditions in cities, for example by providing cheaper, more secure housing and improving urban (11) &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p> <p>Step 4&mdash;Find the answer</p>\n<p>Looking at the sentence you can see that you need a noun which can be described by urban. If you scan the words in the box you can eliminate reducing, urban, rural, groumg, expensive and does. Looking back at the summary sentence you will sec that the first example of improving urban conditions is &lsquo;cheaper, more secure housing&rsquo;. You need to find another example, so it is also unlikely that the answer is housing.</p>\n<p>Now scan paragraph H. The second sentence in that paragraph mentions four solutions to improve conditions in cities&mdash;land, materials, tenure and employment. The first three are covered by the words &lsquo;cheaper, more secure housing&rsquo; in the summary, and the fourth solution, employment, is not mentioned in the choices in the box. Therefore you must go on to the third sentence in paragraph H, which talks about &lsquo;reversing appalling environmental deterioration&rsquo;. If you look in the box for a noun form of &lsquo;environmental&rsquo; or its synonym, you will find the word environments. This is the answer.</p> <p>Questions 12&mdash;13</p>\n<p>These questions arc not answered here. At the end of Section 3 you will be asked to answer them, using the skills and strategies that you learn later.</p> <p>Analysis and Practice</p>\n<p>As with Section 2 of the test, in Section 3 there are main idea questions and questions for specific information. Skimming and scanning are very useful. You will probably find these skills difficult to acquire, initially, but with continued practice you will see more clearly how useful they are.</p>\n<p>To read any complete text carefully takes time so remember that to answer questions about a text you only need to read parts of the text carefully. Skimming and scanning will help you find those important parts of the text so you will not waste time on irrelevant parts of the text.</p> <p>ACTIVITY 16</p> <p>In the following text some of the words have been printed in black. These are an example of the words you might read while skimming to identify the organization of the text. Read only the words in black print and then try to complete the table of the main topics of the various paragraphs below.</p>\n<p>Time target: 4 minutes</p> <p>The Coming Crisis In Long-Term Care</p>\n<p>1. The greying of America has many health-care planners worried. The life expectancies of even the very old (85 and older) have increased significantly in recent years. But at the same time, this group faces the highest risk of chronic disease and disability requiring long-term care. Paying for this care could wipe out the entire life savings of many people within a year.</p>\n<p>2. The number of Americans aged 85 and older is expected to grow three to four times as fast as the general population between 1990 and 2010 and is expected to increase from 2 million in 1980 to 16 million by the year 2050. Of major significance for long-term care arc the lengthening life expectancies at age 85, which have increased 24% since 1960 and are projected to increase mother 44% by 2040.</p>\n<p>3. While only 5% of Americans over 65 currently reside in nursing homes, that percentage rises sharply with age. Twenty-two per cent of persons 85 and older live in nursing homes.</p>\n<p>4. According to national estimates, one year in a nursing home costs an average of $22 000, and this figure is expected to more than double by 2018. Given that the mean income for Americans aged 65 and older is currently $19 000, most people in that age group will simply not be able to stay in nursing homes.</p>\n<p>5. Long-term care is costly even when provided in the home. One study found that more than 60% of elderly people living alone and 40% of elderly couples would become impoverished after one year of seven-days-a-week care.</p>\n<p>6. Many people still mistakenly believe that Medicare covers long-term chronic care, the report says. But Medicare typically covers hospital and physicians&rsquo; costs for acute illnesses or injuries and covers nursing-home stays of no more than 150 days. Awareness of Medicare&rsquo;s limitations is growing, however, and more people now see some form of long term care insurance as desirable to protect against financial ruin.</p>\n<p>7. But how will such insurance be funded&mdash;publicly or privately? While some groups urge a publicly funded program, there are grave doubts about the willingness of taxpayers to pay for a public program. The federal government already faces a budget deficit, which threatens cutbacks in existing programs. The substantial extra expenditure of a publicly funded program would certainly lose votes.</p>\n<p>8. Two possible routes for private insurance plans are individual plans and employer-sponsored plans. Individual policies covering long-term care are currently the most widely available coverage. In 1983, only 16 companies offer individual care policies. In 1988, there were more than 100. By 1987, about 400 000 people owned long-term care insurance policies; in 1988, there were more than 1 million. However, these are mostly younger workers. The number of those over 65 with such policies today is still relatively small, at approximately 100 000.</p>\n<p>9. Employer-sponsored plans are, however, gaining acceptance especially when offered as part of a flexible, or &lsquo;cafeteria&rsquo;, benefits program.</p>\n<p>10. Providing for long-term care insurance through employer groups can help lower plan costs by spreading the long-term care risk over a larger risk pool and through concurrent savings in administrative costs. Another advantage of employer &ndash; sponsored plans over individual policies is that they encourage younger workers to enter the program. The younger the participant is at the time of entering the program, the lower are his or her premium rates. Successful plans would also have an inflation-protection feature.</p>\n<p>11. Employer-sponsored programs are unlikely to be paid entirely&mdash;or even partly&mdash;by employers. Rather, employee-pay-all plans are the most likely scenario, given the rising employer costs for the employer-paid benefit plans already in effect.</p>\n<p>12. Individuals would thus still be responsible for footing the bill for their own long-term care. But by planning well ahead of time and entering early in an employer -sponsored insurance plan, an individual may pay as little $20 a month in premium.</p> <p>  </p>\n<p>Check your answers in the Answer Key.</p>\n<p>Completing a Table</p>\n<p>The first activity related to this text is completing a table.

Then complete the chart following the text to show that you have identified the organization of the text. You should be able to complete the chart quickly by skimming. Do not waste time reading the text carefully.</p> <p>Time target: 4 minutes</p> <p>Killer Robots</p>\n<p>Rules for working safely</p>\n<p>A. Robots are taking over many hazardous jobs, but they are also creating new hazards, according to a report by the International Labour Office (ILO).</p>\n<p>B. Being struck by a robot arm in motion, being trapped between the robot and another object, and being hit by an object dropped by an overloaded robot gripper are the main hazards that robots pose to humans, according to the report. Safety in the Use of Industrial Robots. In many cases, workers are in the way when the robot makes a sudden, unexpected movement or starts when it isn&rsquo;t supposed to. Such miscues may result from software problems, electrical interference, or faults in the hydraulic, electrical, or pneumatic controls.</p>\n<p>C. The first robot-related death occurred in Japan in 1981, and one survey of robot use in Japan showed a total of 10 fatalities reported by the end of April 1987. The causes were the victim&rsquo;s error in four cases and &lsquo;spontaneous start of robot&rsquo; in the other six, according to Japan&rsquo;s Ministry of Labour. Each year, approximately five or six workers are injured in robot accidents in Japan, and there have been many more &lsquo;near-misses&rsquo;. But, as the ILO points out, more than 100 000 robots are used in Japanese factories.</p>\n<p>D. In the United States as well, control problems account for a large share of injuries to workers, but one fatality described in the report was the result of a worker simply ignoring safety precautions and attempting to clean up an area where a robot was operating.</p>\n<p>E. Even when robots arc used safely, other problems may develop, says the report. When robots create unemployment of humans, workers may suffer from ulcers, colitis, and emotional stress. New jobs created by robotization generate stress, too, such as anxiety in trying to keep pace with a robot&rsquo;s work pace.</p>\n<p>F. &lsquo;In general, while technological innovation may free people from physical labour, it may give rise to mental load,&rsquo; the report notes, &lsquo;and it is thought likely that new occupational diseases may arise in time. The development of a special curriculum, in Japan known as robot medicine, acknowledges the connection between emerging technology and stress.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>G. The report cites several rules for robot workers that may help prevent future injuries. For example, robots should be easy to operate. Robots should also be designed so that in the event of a breakdown, they can only harm themselves and not humans. In addition, robots should leave an area after finishing their task so that they do not interfere with other workers&mdash;human or robotic.</p>\n<p>H. The report also mentions rules that will help reduce robot-related anxieties. Robots must not replace people in desirable jobs but only jobs people do not wish to do or find dangerous. Also, robots must obey humans so that they do not psychologically or physically oppress people. Finally, if robots replace humans on a job, the people affected must give their approval.</p> <p>Paragraph Main topic</p>\n<p>A Introduction</p>\n<p>B The ways that injuries happen</p>\n<p>C</p>\n<p>D</p>\n<p>E and F</p>\n<p>G</p>\n<p>H</p> <p>Check your answers in the Answer Key.</p> <p>In the next activity, there arc three question types for the text you have just read.

Only if you have a good understanding of the text, you can answer the questions more precisely and effectively.</p> <p><strong>Be able to Categorize</strong></p>\n<p>IELTS exam writers select a range of specific type of texts. You need to learn to recognize the type of text you are reading. It will help you predict its structure and you will be able to understand it more quickly. There are four types of IELTS Reading texts &ndash; A) analytic texts that will discuss the reasons why something happened or make recommendations or explain a concept B) descriptive texts that describe a situation, explain how something is done or categorize something C) discursive texts in which different opinions are expressed about an issue and D) narrative texts that explain a chronological sequence of events.</p> <p><strong>Skimming</strong></p>\n<p>Develop the ability to skim. Skimming means to read quickly by skipping the unimportant words like prepositions and ignoring the difficult words that you don&rsquo;t have to understand. You should do this to get a general idea about a text or a paragraph or while intensively searching for the answer of a question.</p> <p><strong>Scanning</strong></p>\n<p>You must learn to scan. Scanning is exactly what you do when you look for a price in advertising text or a name in a telephone book. While scanning you do not actually need to read the text but move your eyes quickly over it. You can scan either left to right or right to left, from top to bottom or bottom to top. You should do this to find out the location of answers in the texts looking out for easy to spot words like numbers, dates and words beginning with capital letters such as place names.</p> <p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n<p>Learn to recognize paragraph structure. This involves spotting the relationship between main ideas and supporting ideas in a paragraph. Paragraphs are mostly descending i.e., they start with the main idea somewhere near the start and develop from there, however some, frequently first and the last paragraphs of the texts, are ascending &ndash; the main idea is found to be located towards the end. This can prove to be helpful particularly when matching the headings to the paragraphs.</p> <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Get the overview of a text before beginning with the questions. Do this by reading the title and the subtitle as well as focusing on the beginnings and ends of paragraphs. This will help you process the information in a text.</p> <p><strong>Similar phrases</strong></p>\n<p>Develop the skill to spot similar phrases. There are different ways of expressing the same thing, such as, &ldquo;I like to ski&rdquo; and &ldquo;skiing is enjoyable&rdquo;. Many questions, for example, YES NO NOT GIVEN questions and gap fills, test your ability to match up a parallel phrase in the task with its equivalent in the text.</p> <p><strong>Stop panicking</strong></p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t panic when you face an unknown or difficult word. IELTS texts are packed with highly specialized vocabulary and therefore you are advised to read relevant texts beforehand to prepare. Skip over difficult words which are unnecessary for your understanding of the text. For words you need to understand, practice trying to guess their meaning using the overall context of the text.</p> <p><strong>Time management</strong></p>\n<p>Manage time in the exam. Most of the IELTS candidates complain about running out of time in the third reading section. Each text should take you about 20 minutes (the examiner will bring it to your notice when 20 minutes have passed). Never spend too long on a single question &ndash; either guess the answer if you don&rsquo;t know the answer exactly or skip the question and return to it later. Also, if you feel you are running out of time, tackle questions like gap fills before attempting &ldquo;easy-to-guess&rdquo; tasks.</p>",

        "content": "<p>All of the information in this section applies to both the Academic and General Training IELTS Reading exams. Let&rsquo;s start with some important keys to success:</p> <p><strong>Pacing</strong></p>\n<p>Pacing is critical in order to do well on the IELTS Reading paper. This is especially true for the Academic IELTS, but it also applies to the General Training Reading exam. Sixty minutes is not a lot of time get through all of the passages and answer 40 questions. Since each question is worth the same amount of points (1), it makes most sense to divide the 3 sections equally&mdash;spending 20 minutes per section.</p> <p>Instead of reading each passage carefully, it works much better for most people to &ldquo;skim&rdquo; the Reading passages. This is something we will discuss in detail in the &ldquo;Strategy&rdquo; section of this post below. I advise my students to spend 3 to 5 minutes quickly skimming the passage before looking at the questions. That leaves 15 to 17 minutes to study the questions and find answers in the text.</p> <p>Note: Unlike the Listening exam, you do not have an extra 10 minutes to transfer answers from your Test Booklet to your Answer Sheet. On the Reading paper, you need to record all of your final answers on the Answer Sheet within 60 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>\n<p>Scoring is fairly simple on the Reading section. Each question is worth 1 point, so you can achieve a &ldquo;raw&rdquo; score of up to 40 points. From there, IELTS converts your &ldquo;raw&rdquo; score into your Band score. You can find a basic band score conversion table on the official IELTS website. However, keep in mind that each version of the IELTS is slightly different. The tables can give you a general idea about how &ldquo;raw&rdquo; Reading scores are converted to band scores.</p> <p>It is also important to keep in mind that the hardest questions and the easiest questions count equally towards your final Reading score. Therefore, if you&rsquo;re struggling to finish all of the questions within 60 minutes, make sure you&rsquo;re not losing out on easier points because you get stuck on hard questions. Sometimes, you simply won&rsquo;t understand a question or a segment within a passage fully. Other times, no matter how hard you try, you won&rsquo;t find an answer in the text. If this happens, just make your best guess and move on so you don&rsquo;t miss out on easier points later in the test! You can always return to a difficult question later if you have spare time at the end.</p> <p><strong>Vocabulary</strong></p>\n<p>The more vocabulary you know, the easier the IELTS Reading exam will be for you. Vocabulary is very, very important if you&rsquo;re aiming for a high Band score. As you prepare for the exam, make sure to study new words regularly. Your goal should be to learn 15 to 20 new words each day.</p> <p>Also, try to read in English regularly (15 to 20 minutes per day at least!). It&rsquo;s an excellent idea to keep a vocabulary journal as you read. Record new and unfamiliar words, and then define each one with a synonym or short definition. Keep it simple. You should return to your list a few times each week to review, focusing attention on terms you have difficulty remembering. Additionally, Magoosh offers a Vocabulary Flashcard app and a Vocabulary PDF word list for the IELTS. (Bonus: They&rsquo;re both free!) No matter how you prefer to review vocabulary, study a little bit every day!</p> <p><strong>Focus on the Directions</strong></p>\n<p>Attention to detail is very important on the IELTS Reading paper. Unfortunately, too many test-takers lose points unnecessarily because they don&rsquo;t pay close attention to the directions. The directions for each task will tell you how to mark answers on your Answer Sheet. For example, some questions require numerals (i, ii, iii, iv, v, etc), while others require letters (A, B, C, etc). Short Answer questions are even more complicated. The directions may say something like, &ldquo;Choose NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS from the passage.&rdquo;</p> <p>Each set of questions will have its own instructions telling you how to mark your answers. As you practice, get into the habit of looking at these instructions every time. You don&rsquo;t want to miss points because you didn&rsquo;t notice a key detail in the directions.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The IELTS Reading exam is probably different than the English reading tests you&rsquo;ve taken in school. Most of the time, reading exams involve carefully reading a passage from beginning to end, and then answering comprehension questions about it. In theory, this is also what you should do on the IELTS Reading paper.</p> <p>In practice, this approach doesn&rsquo;t work very well for most people. The reason is simple&mdash;there simply isn&rsquo;t enough time on the IELTS Reading paper to read each passage slowly and carefully AND answer all of the questions. This is especially true on the Academic IELTS, where you only have 60 minutes to read 3 long and complex passages. On the General Training IELTS, it may be possible to read each passage carefully if you are a proficient reader. Nevertheless, I still recommend a different approach. Try these strategies as you practice:</p> <p><strong>Strategy 1:</strong> Skim each passage for 3 to 5 minutes before looking at the questions.</p>\n<p>Learning to skim a passage effectively can save you a lot of time. To skim, simply look over each paragraph quickly, but in a strategic way. You should read the first line or two of each paragraph normally, but then you should go over the rest much faster. As you skim, you&rsquo;re trying to notice words that stand out because they seem important. This helps you to get the &ldquo;gist,&rdquo; or the basic sense of each paragraph.</p> <p>The ultimate goal of skimming is to notice things in the text that will help you answer questions. You may find people&rsquo;s names, or important dates. You may also figure out how a passage is organized.</p> <p>For example, imagine you are reading a historical text. Often, historical passages are organized chronologically, from the beginning of a time period to the end. Skimming effectively will help you to notice this organizational pattern, and this knowledge will most likely help you to find answers to questions more quickly. Any time you get a question that includes a date or time reference, you&rsquo;ll know where to look because you&rsquo;ve skimmed the passage effectively.</p> <p>Here is a summary of the key skimming techniques you should master:</p> <p>Notice the title of the passage. It often gives you a general idea about the main idea of the text.</p>\n<p>Read the first sentence or two of each paragraph. Often, this is where the main idea of each paragraph is located.</p>\n<p>Underline words that stand out to you as important. This will help you get a general idea of what is being talked about.</p>\n<p>Pick out words that have something in common (i.e., airports, passengers, lounge, fly).</p>\n<p>Ignore words that you do not know. Focusing on words that are unfamiliar to you will slow you down.</p>\n<p>At all times, try not to get caught up in the detail when you skim!</p> <p><strong>Strategies 2 and 3:</strong> As you skim, underline keywords in the text and write short notes as reminders in the text.</p>\n<p>Strategies 2 and 3 work together with the skimming strategy above. Basically, the goal of &ldquo;underlining&rdquo; and taking &ldquo;notes&rdquo; as you skim is that this helps you remember what you learned when you go to answer questions. It&rsquo;s very simple. Here&rsquo;s what you should do:</p> <p>As you skim, quickly underline each word that seems important in your Question Booklet (which contains your Reading passage). In other words, don&rsquo;t just skim with your eyes. Use your pencil to underline things that stand out as you skim the passage.</p> <p>Secondly, as you skim, quickly write very short notes (2-5 words) next to each paragraph with your best guess about the main idea of that paragraph. You don&rsquo;t have to be comprehensive or even 100% right about your &ldquo;guess&rdquo; in order for it to be useful. To be sure, if you had time to read the paragraph carefully, you could almost certainly come up with very good and accurate summary notes. But you might be surprised how close you can come to the main idea of each paragraph just from skimming.</p> <p><strong>Strategy 4:</strong> Study the questions, noting keywords, and SCAN the text strategically for answers</p>\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve thoroughly skimmed the text, you&rsquo;re ready to turn to the questions. Each question type is slightly different, so you&rsquo;ll have to vary your approach in some ways for each new set of questions. However, the strategy discussed in this section applies to them all. The basic concept is simple: First, read the questions carefully and look for keywords. Then, you scan the passage for answers.</p> <p>When you look for keywords in the questions, you should underline the most important ones. This may sound like a lot of extra work, but it really shouldn&rsquo;t require a lot of time. As you read, simply use your pencil to mark up the questions.</p> <p>These keywords provide the concepts for which you&rsquo;ll need to search in the passage. As you&rsquo;re probably aware, IELTS questions almost never use the same language as the actual reading passage (except for incorrect answer choices!). Instead, the questions will be paraphrases of information found in the article. This is one way the IELTS tests your vocabulary.</p> <p>Paraphrases will be synonyms or different forms of words found in the text. A paraphrase could also be an entire sentence that conveys the same meaning as a sentence in the passage, while using different words and sentence structures. When you underline keywords in the questions, you&rsquo;re identifying the IDEAS you need to search for in the passage.</p> <p>Use a strategic approach when you scan the reading passage for answers. It&rsquo;s best to begin with questions that have keywords you think you can find easily in the text. When you answer questions that are &ldquo;easy&rdquo; to locate, you will learn a little more about what is contained in the Reading passage because you had to read some segments closely to confirm your answers. This process continues with each question you answer. It is possible (and fairly common!) to find an answer to a different question than the one you&rsquo;re searching for at that moment.</p> <p>What makes one question easier to scan for in the text than another? Perhaps a question stands out to you because you remember seeing the topic in the text when you skimmed, underlined, and took notes at the very beginning. But there are some other things that can make an answer easier to find by scanning. For example, numbers and proper nouns like names or locations often stand out visually in a text. A date like 1950, and the names Jane Smith and New York City would be very easy to locate among other words. Once you find the words you&rsquo;re looking for, read the surrounding sentences carefully to find the answer to your question.</p>",

It is commonly found in parts two, three and four of the listening test.</p>\n<p>The questions will be harder the further on you get in the sections of the test.</p>\n<p>There are certain things in this kind of question that can easily trip you up and lead to mistakes. Learning about these will improve your ability to listen and identify the correct answer.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons why this type of question can be difficult and we'll now look at some IELTS listening multiple choice tips to help you understand this.</p>\n<h5><strong>What are the difficulties with IELTS Listening Multiple Choice Questions?</strong></h5>\n<p><strong><em>Hearing all the words</em></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this type of question, it is very likely that you will hear ALL the words that you are given in each choice. Two will obviously not be referring to the answer, so you need to listen very carefully to make sure you get the correct one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Similar Choices</em></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another problem is that you may be given very similar choices. For example, all the choices may refer to &lsquo;<em>years</em>&rsquo;, so it is easy to choose the wrong one. Also, the information you hear about each choice may be quite similar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Paraphrases and synonyms</em></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, sentences and words that you hear in the listening will often be changed in the actual listening script. The test would be quite easy if you could heard exactly what you see in the question, but it will be changed in some way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>A different order</em></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The person you hear speaking may not necessarily give you the information or choices in the same order as the question you see on the paper.   </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5><strong>A Real Example of a Question</strong></h5>\n<p>In this next part of the IELTS listening multiple choice tips, we look at an example to explain the points above a bit more.</p>\n<p>This is taken from a real IELTS test. It is from section 2 of the test, so it will be slightly easier than a multiple choice that you would get in sections 3 or 4, but the same principles apply.</p>\n<p>Below the question is the section of the listening script that refers to the question.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>\"1.</strong>  PS Camping has been organising holidays for</p>\n<p><strong>         A.</strong>  15 years  <br /><strong>         B.</strong>  20 years  <br /><strong>         C.</strong>  25 years  </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">____________</p>\n<p><em>Thank you for coming to my talk this evening. It&rsquo;s nice to see so many people in the audience. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know very much about PS Camping, let me start by giving you some background information about the company.<br /></em></p>\n<p><em>The company started twenty five years ago. It actually started as a retail chain selling camping equipment, and then twenty years ago, it bought a small number of campsites in the UK, and began offering camping holidays. The company grew rapidly and has been providing holidays in continental Europe for the last fifteen years.\"</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>So you should be able to spot some of the difficult things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You hear  <strong>all the words &ndash;  </strong>25 years, 20 years and 15 years.</li>\n<li>There are  <strong>similarities in the choices -  </strong>they are all years with a mix of the numbers &lsquo;<em>twenty</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>five</em>&rsquo; in there and they all mention about the company or holidays.</li>\n<li>The question stem has been  <strong>paraphrased</strong>  - nowhere does it say &ldquo;<em>organising holidays</em>&rdquo;. Instead you can see phrases like &ldquo;<em>began offering holidays</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>providing holidays</em>&rdquo;. This can be particularly confusing because you have to understand which one fits with the question.</li>\n<li>The possible answers are in a  <strong>different order  </strong>to the audio &ndash; you hear &lsquo;<em>25</em>&rsquo; first and &lsquo;<em>15</em>&rsquo; last.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><strong>How do you answer multiple choice questions?</strong></h5>\n<p>The first thing you need to do is  <strong>look through the questions</strong>. You have 30 seconds to do this before you hear the audio.</p>\n<p>Underline<strong>  key words</strong>  in the question stems and look at the choices so you know what to listen out for.</p>\n<p>So in this first one, you may underline &ldquo;<em>Organised Holidays</em>&rdquo;. You should focus on the question stem but also look at the choices and note that you are listening out for &lsquo;<em>years</em>&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>In this case, this sentence should tell you that you have got to the section of the listening where the answer will be:</p>\n<p>\"<em><strong>The company started twenty five years ago</strong>.  </em><em>It actually started as a retail chain selling camping equipment, and then twenty years ago, it bought a small number of campsites in the UK, and began offering camping holidays. The company grew rapidly and has been providing holidays in continental Europe for the last fifteen years.</em>\"</p>\n<p>So when you hear this, make sure you are  <strong>looking carefully at the question</strong>  and the choices and  <strong>listening extremely carefully</strong>.</p>\n<p>You need to listen carefully for what is said about each year so that you can identify the right answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>1.  </strong>PS Camping has been organising holidays for:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A.</strong>  15 years<br />[<strong><em>has been providing holidays</em></strong><em>  in continental Europe for the last fifteen years]</em></p>\n<p><strong>B.</strong>  20 years<br />[<em>twenty years ago, it bought a small number of campsites in the UK, and  <strong>began offering camping holidays</strong></em>]</p>\n<p><strong>C.</strong>  25 years<br />[<em>The  <strong>company started</strong>  twenty five years ago]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can see how the question tries to trick you!</p>\n<p>It  <strong>distracts you</strong>  from the correct answer by giving other statements that are quite similar to the correct answer.<br /><span id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\" class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\"></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\" class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\"></span>The answer is  <strong>B</strong>, but you could easily end up thinking it is  <strong>A</strong>  or  <strong>C</strong>  if you are not listening carefully enough.</p>\n<p>The company  <strong>started</strong>  25 years ago, but that is  <strong>NOT</strong>  when they started offering holidays for camping.</p>\n<p>It later clarifies that they did not start  <strong>offering / organising holidays</strong>  until 5 years later (20 years ago) when they bought a campsite.</p>\n<p>It is not  <strong>A</strong>  because this is just when they starting  <strong>providing holidays</strong>  in Europe, which came later. That is not what the question asks. The question ask generally.</p>",

The numbers (15, 16, 17) will follow the order of the listening.</li>\n<li><span class=\"red\">Understand the context  </span>- listen carefully at the beginning as the speaker will give you the context. (where you are for example) which will help you follow the talk. Also, look over the map.

So it is possible that signposting will be used within this.</p>\n<p>This lesson is designed to help you with  <strong>Section 4 IELTS listenings</strong>  that are a  <strong>lecture</strong>, though the language for a presentation or talk may be the same or similar.</p>\n<p>If you know the type of language that is used to guide you, it will help you to  <strong>follow the lecture</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is particuarly important if your listening skills are weaker than they should be because you will easily get lost if you don't know where you are.</p>\n<p>Also, the lecture may be split into two parts.</p>\n<p>t may be the case that these two sections follow the sections that the speaker divides their talk into i.e. two parts. Knowing then the lecture structure and the language the speaker uses to tell you they are moving onto the second section will help you to follow where you are.</p>\n<p>The signposting language we'll look at in this lesson is the words and phrases that  <strong>introduce the topics</strong>  and  <strong>subsections</strong>  of the lecture.</p> <h5>Examples of Lecture Signposting Language</h5>\n<p>This table sets out some of the key language that guides you on the overall  <strong>topic and content</strong>  of the lecture, and when  <strong>different sections</strong>  of the lecture are being discussed.</p>\n<p>The table includes the signposting language to signal the end of the talk. However you are every unlikly to hear this used in IELTS because as section 4 of the listening is only around 4-5 minutes, you only usually hear the first part of the lecture or presentation.</p>\n<p>Remember there are lots of different ways to say these things, so what you hear could be phrased slightly differently.</p>\n<center>\n<h5>Signposting Examples</h5>\n</center><center>\n<div>\n<table border=\"1\" width=\"500\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"col\" width=\"128\">Purpose</th>\n<th scope=\"col\" width=\"314\">Signpost Language</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Introducing the topic of the lecture</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Today we are going to talk about&hellip;</li>\n<li>The topic of today&rsquo;s lecture is&hellip;</li>\n<li>This morning we are going to take a look at&hellip;</li>\n<li>Today I&rsquo;ll be talking about / discussing...</li>\n<li>What I&rsquo;m going to be talking about today is&hellip;</li>\n<li>The purpose of today&rsquo;s lecture is&hellip;</li>\n<li>The subject/topic of my talk is ...</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Explaining the lecture structure (sections / subtopics)</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>In today&rsquo;s lecture I&rsquo;m going to cover three points.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;m going to divide this talk into three parts.</li>\n<li>First we&rsquo;ll look at&hellip;..

This skill is an important one to learn as it helps you to get the correct answer.</p>\n<p>In this lesson we will look at it in relation to a '<strong>Note Completion</strong>' task, which you will often see in Section 1, the easiest part of the test.</p>\n<p>Prediction though can be used for any type of question where you have to fill in a gap, so it can apply to other parts of the test.</p>\n<h5>Pre-Listening Activities Practice</h5>\n<p>Before each listening section, you have some time to look at the questions.</p>\n<p>You should use this time to look through the questions and get an idea of what you are going to be listening for and when it is a gap filling exercise you should try to predict the types of thing you need to be listening for.</p>\n<p>This will help with your listening ability.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the notes on  <em>Library Membership</em>, and try to predict the information that you may need.</p>\n<p>Which questions may need:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>a) a number?</em></p>\n<p><em>b) a name (of a person)?</em></p>\n<p><em>c) a place?</em></p>\n<p><em>d) a date or day/month/year?</em></p>\n<p><em>e) another word?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order to prepare you for the listening, write a  <strong>letter</strong>  <em>(</em><em>  a, b, c, d, or e)</em>  in the box to indicate what type of information you think you will hear:</p>\n<center>\n<h5>Library Membership</h5>\n</center> <p>Minimum joining age: 18 years</p>\n<p>For registration must take:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two<strong>  (1)</strong>  <input size=\"5\" type=\"text\" />  and</li>\n<li>Two forms of ID e.g. driving licence  <strong>(2)</strong>  <input size=\"5\" type=\"text\" /></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cost to join per year (without current student card:<strong>  (3)</strong>  <input size=\"5\" type=\"text\" /></p>\n<p>Number of items allowed: (member of public)  <strong>(4)</strong>  <input size=\"5\" type=\"text\" /></p>\n<p>Loan Times: four weeks</p>\n<p>Fines start at:<strong>  (5)</strong>  &pound;  <input size=\"5\" type=\"text\" /></p> <center>________________</center> <p>Computers can be booked up to  <strong>(6)  </strong><input size=\"5\" type=\"text\" />  hours in advance</p>\n<p>Library holds most national papers,  <strong>(7)</strong>  <input size=\"5\" type=\"text\" />  , and magazines</p>\n<p>Need  <strong>(8)</strong>  <input size=\"5\" type=\"text\" />  to use photocopier</p>\n<p><strong>Creative Writing Class</strong></p>\n<p>Tutor is John  <strong>(9)  </strong><input size=\"5\" type=\"text\" /></p>\n<p>Held on  <strong>(10)</strong>  <input size=\"5\" type=\"text\" />  evenings</p>\n<h5>Other Words</h5>\n<p>It is not just though about guessing whether it is a  <em>number, name</em>  etc. You should also try to predict what some of the  <em>'other words</em>' will be.</p>\n<p>You may find you can guess some correctly without even listening (though of course you must listen to check you are right!).</p>\n<p>For example, in question  <strong>(1)</strong>  you need  <strong>two of something</strong>  along with the  <em>ID for registration</em>.</p>\n<p>What do you often need to take '<em>two of</em>' to register for something? You should be able to guess.</p>\n<p>Or for question  <strong>(2)</strong>  it will be another form of ID. What kind of things can you use for ID apart from a driving licence?</p>\n<p>Again, you should be able to guess some possibilties without even listening.</p>\n<h5><strong>Beware of Distractors!</strong></h5>\n<p>Unfortunately it is never going to be made too simple for you as the aim is to separate those with weaker skills from those with stronger skills.</p>\n<p>For most questions, you are likely to hear  <strong>two or more possibilities</strong>  for the answer.</p>\n<p>For example, in question  <strong>(3)</strong>  you are looking for the  <em>cost</em>  <strong>without</strong>  a current student card. That means you are very likely to hear the  <em>cost</em><strong>  with</strong>  one as well. So you need to listen carefully to get the right one.</p>\n<p>Again, in question  <strong>(4)  </strong>you are asked about the  <em>number of items allowed</em>  for a  <strong>member of the public</strong>. So there is probably a different number for a  <strong>student</strong>. You need to get the right number.</p>\n<p><span id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\" class=\"ezoic-adpicker-ad\"></span>This will be true of probably many of the questions - you will hear  <strong>more than one choice</strong>  but only one will be correct.</p>\n<p>If you knew a number was coming up and there was just one number given, it would be too easy!</p>\n<p>Now take a listen and try to answer the questions. Remember:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>read the instructions carefully for the word/number limits for each question</em></li>\n<li><em>write the words exactly as you hear them (don't change them)</em></li>\n<li><em>make sure your spelling is correct</em></li>\n</ul>\n<center></center>",

Should it be a verb, noun, adjective?</li>\n</ul> <ul>\n<li><strong><span class=\"red\">Use British or American spelling</span></strong>  &ndash; this is what is says on the official IELTS website: &rdquo;<em>IELTS recognises both British and American English in terms of spelling, grammar and choice of words</em>&rdquo;. So you can use either in your answers.</li>\n</ul> <ul>\n<li><strong><span class=\"red\">Don&rsquo;t worry about what you write on the exam sheet</span></strong>  &ndash; in practice tests, it is common to see students rubbing or crossing things out on the exam paper. Remember that nobody sees or marks what you write here. Don&rsquo;t waste time getting the spelling correct or anything else. If you do this you&rsquo;ll get lost &ndash; you need to be listening. So just write down what you hear then move on. When you transfer the answers at the end to the answer sheet, you can make sure you have the correct spelling.</li>\n</ul> <ul>\n<li><strong><span class=\"red\">Read the instructions</span></strong>  &ndash; an IELTS listening tip that is an important tip for any part of the test is to always read the instructions carefully. They will tell you how many words to use. If it asks for no more than two words and you use three, it will be wrong. And you must only put in the words asked for. For example, if there is a gap of &ldquo;<em>at &hellip;&hellip; pm</em>&rdquo; and you write &ldquo;<em>at 5pm</em>&rdquo; on the answer sheet, it will be wrong. You should only write what is missing i.e. &ldquo;<em>5</em>&rdquo;.</li>\n</ul> <ul>\n<li><strong><span class=\"red\">Use upper or lower case letters</span></strong>  &ndash; a question often asked is whether you can use upper case letters. This is what it says on the official British Council Website: &ldquo;<em>You may write your answers in lower case or capital letters</em>&rdquo;. So you can write all your answers in capital letters if you like. This statement from the British Council suggests, therefore, that you will not be penalised if you write &lsquo;<em>paris</em>&rsquo; for example, instead of &lsquo;<em>Paris</em>&rsquo; because it says you can use lower case letters. However, it is recommended that you try and use capitalisation correctly to be on the safe side. If you are not sure if the first letter needs capitalisation, then capitalise the whole word.</li>\n</ul> <ul>\n<li><strong><span class=\"red\">Get used to the British accent</span></strong>  &ndash; a good IELTS listening tip is to be prepared to hear all accents as you may hear Australian, American, Canadian, New Zealand and a mix of European countries. However, although there are a mix of accents in the test, the majority tend to be British (unlike TOEFL which tends to be American). So make sure you are used to the British accent.</li>\n</ul> <ul>\n<li><strong><span class=\"red\">Practice the pronunciation of letter and numbers</span></strong>  &ndash; often words are spelt out in the test by a speaker and numbers are read out, so make sure you can recognise how different letters sound in different accents, not just words.</li>\n</ul> <ul>\n<li><strong><span class=\"red\">Careful with what you write down</span></strong>  &ndash; speakers in the test will often give an answer but then correct themselves. So the first answer that looks right may actually be wrong.</li>\n</ul> <ul>\n<li><strong><span class=\"red\">Don&rsquo;t leave answers blank</span></strong>  &ndash; you will not get penalised for writing the wrong answer (as opposed to nothing if you are not sure what it is) so guess if that is possible.</li>\n</ul> <ul>\n<li><strong><span class=\"red\">Transfer your answers to the answer sheet carefully</span></strong>  &ndash; if you put correct answers in the wrong place on the answer sheet it will be wrong, so make sure you put the answer in the correct place. It is easy to do this if you leave an answer blank on the exam sheet. You may then fill that one in with the wrong answer when you transfer them across. So put in a guess for any you do not know and leave no blanks.</li>\n</ul> <ul>\n<li><strong><span class=\"red\">Check your answers</span></strong>  - make sure you recheck your spelling and grammar too when you transfer your answers at the end.</li>\n</ul> <ul>\n<li><strong><span class=\"red\">Listen very carefully</span></strong>  - listen very very carefully throughout the test. Zone in and focus. Don&rsquo;t be distracted by anything around you, and don&rsquo;t panic if you think you having missed any answers or that you are getting them wrong. All this will do is distract you from listening.</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<ul>\n<li><strong><span class=\"red\">Practice listening</span></strong>  &ndash; of all the IELTS listening tips, this is one of the most important. Make sure you practice listening as much as you can! You can practice with sample IELTS listening tests but you should also expose yourself to as much English as you can. Target it at the level you are currently at. There is no point in listening to BBC World if you don&rsquo;t understand any of it. Find resources on the internet that suit your level and gradually increase difficulty. And don&rsquo;t worry if they are not exams or specifically for IELTS, any kind of listening helps. Try to make listening fun and listen to things you like. You can move on to more difficult things as you improve.</li>\n</ul> <ul>\n<li><span class=\"red\"><strong>Listen to lectures</strong>  </span>&ndash; remember that the last part is a lecture, so practice listening to lectures and taking notes. Lectures often follow certain patterns, such as an introduction to tell you the topic and main points, and they have sign-posts to tell you if they are comparing e.g. \"<em>although</em>\", or moving onto a new main points e.g. &ldquo;<em>Now I&rsquo;ll discuss&hellip;.</em>&rdquo;. So listening to lectures will help you with this section. You can find lectures online if you do a search.

So you should practice this too. One way to do this is with practice tests but you can also try listening to audios and taking notes at the same time.

        "content": "<p>This is an idea about how to improve speaking about likes and dislikes in IELTS. The very simple idea is that one way to improve is to practise speaking about what you like and dislike about some similar things &ndash; in this case leisure activities. I show you ways to do this by</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>speaking about how much you like something</strong></li>\n<li><strong>giving reasons for your preferences</strong></li>\n<li><strong>making comparisons between your preferences</strong></li>\n<li><strong>talking about consequences</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doing this should help your fluency in all 3 parts of the speaking test.</p> <p><strong>A possible model</strong></p>\n<p>The goal here is to work on your fluency and speaking skills and not necessarily produce an &ldquo;IELTS&rdquo; answer to an IELTS question. Rather I suggest you use this as a model to show you the different ways you can expand your answer</p> <p>My favourite film by far is The Shawshank Redemption. [say what it is and how much]</p> <p>I suppose it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s such a feel-good movie and you can&rsquo;t help but feel uplifted at the end. The plot is fantastic and has a great twist in it at the end but what really makes the film for me is the cast, both the leading actors Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give truly great performances and you really believe in their characters. [give a reason with some detail]</p> <p>I also quite like Fugitive with Harrison Ford &ndash; which is quite similar in some ways &ndash; but it doesn&rsquo;t give me the same feeling just because I don&rsquo;t believe in the characters in the same way. [make a comparison]</p> <p>In fact I enjoy Shawshank so much that I watch it again and again &ndash; I guess I must have seen it about 10 times so far and I never get bored by it. [talk about consequences]</p> <p>  </p>\n<p><strong>Make a list</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some categories of typical leisure activities you may be asked about in IELTS speaking. Choose something you like and dislike in each category. If you think of something you dislike that can often help you with saying why you like something else &ndash; and vice versa. You can not only compare the two things but you can often see more clearly what aspect of that thing/activity is important to you.</p> <p>a film</p> <p>a book</p> <p>a song/piece of music</p> <p>a picture</p> <p>a tv programme</p> <p>a game/sport</p> <p>an indoors activity</p> <p>an outdoors activity</p> <p>Decide how much</p> <p>Not all likes and dislikes are equal. One way you can practise speaking is deciding how much you like/dislike something. Go through your list and decide which of these phrases is most appropriate &ndash; you can of course choose your own too.</p> <p>Note the use of the adverbs such as quite, pretty and really and see how they add meaning to what you say</p> <p>I quite like</p> <p>I&rsquo;m rather fond of</p> <p>I&rsquo;m pretty keen on</p> <p>quite my favourite</p> <p>I really enjoy</p> <p>I absolutely adore</p> <p>I don&rsquo;t particularly like</p> <p>I&rsquo;m not especially fond of</p> <p>I actively dislike</p> <p>My least favourite</p> <p>I positively don&rsquo;t enjoy</p> <p>I detest</p> <p>  </p>\n<p><strong>Say why &ndash; be specific</strong></p>\n<p>You also need to extend your answer and one obvious way to do this is give a reason. Here the two words are reason and because</p> <p>The reason I like [] is</p> <p>I dislike [] is because</p> <p>It can also help to be more specific and to avoid only using words such as interesting and boring when you are giving your reasons. It&rsquo;s often better to focus on one or two particular parts of what you&rsquo;re talking about. This allows you to say more normally. It can also help to focus on how much you like or dislike something as you speak.</p> <p>To get you started, here are one or two quick ideas about more precise aspects of each subject you can talk about.</p> <p>Film &ndash; plot &ndash; characters &ndash; cast &ndash; genre (action/romcom etc)</p> <p>Book &ndash; author- plot &ndash; characters &ndash; genre (detective/classic/romance etc)</p> <p>Music &ndash; rhythm &ndash; lyrics &ndash; genre (dance/house/classical etc)</p> <p>Picture &ndash; setting &ndash; subject &ndash; format</p> <p>TV programme &ndash; actors &ndash; characters &ndash; plot &ndash; episode &ndash; genre (chat show/soap/sitcom etc)</p> <p>Indoors activity (e.g. game) &ndash; when/where you do it &ndash; other people &ndash; purpose</p> <p>Outdoors activity &ndash; when/where you do it &ndash; other people &ndash; purpose</p> <p>  </p>\n<p><strong>Compare it</strong></p>\n<p>Another way to say more is simply compare something you like with something you dislike or like less. One key word here can be prefer</p> <p>I much prefer [] to [] because</p> <p>Try to add to your description of things you enjoy by comparing/contrasting them with things you like less.</p>",

        "content": "<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for some speaking practice for part 1 IELTS, here&rsquo;s a simple idea that may help you improve your skills. You just practise speaking about the same questions in slightly different ways.</p> <p>How does it help? It can be easy to get stuck with trying to find the perfect answer to a question and trying to repeat that when you get to the test. That can put more pressure on you &ndash; especially when you get a slightly unexpected question. This method is different. You go into the test with</p> <p>ideas of different things you can say</p>\n<p>different ways of extending your answer &ndash; the key skill in part 1</p>\n<p>It can help you find answers to unexpected questions and questions you haven&rsquo;t prepared for.</p> <p>  </p>\n<p>Key idea &ndash; try some different ways of saying more</p> <p>What I suggest is that you try answering the same question in 4 different ways. Here are 4 possibilities.</p> <p>adding detail</p>\n<p>talking about different times</p>\n<p>giving a reason</p>\n<p>This list isn&rsquo;t supposed to be complete! There are lots of ways of answering questions. Rather it&rsquo;s supposed to show you that if you think in different ways you can find more to say. Do this exercise enough and you&rsquo;ll soon find you have lots of things to say to even simple questions.</p> <p>Look at these sample answers to the question &ldquo;What do you study?&rsquo;.</p> <p>Detail</p> <p>I&rsquo;m majoring in English but I&rsquo;m also doing French as my minor and taking one or two optional courses in Spanish. We spend most of our time on literature but there are also some modules in language too.</p> <p>Different times</p> <p>I&rsquo;m currently doing a degree at Nottingham Uni &ndash; it&rsquo;s in English . But I&rsquo;ve only been doing that for a couple of months now. Before that I was at Shanghai Central University where I also studied English &ndash; the difference is that there most of the course focussed on the language and not literature.</p> <p>A reason</p> <p>I&rsquo;m actually studying English. I chose to do that as I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed literature and it&rsquo;s also a chance to take my language to another level. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to learn to speak a language really fluently and in the end it should help me find a well-paid job.</p> <p>Quick notes</p> <p>Don&rsquo;t worry about trying to say something completely different each time. That&rsquo;s not really the goal. In practice many of your answers will sound quite similar and contain similar information. Rather what should happen is that each time you change your answer you find another way of talking about the same thing.</p> <p>Do this exercise enough and the process of extending your answers should become what we call &ldquo;second nature&rdquo; &ndash; something you do automatically.</p> <p>See some more examples</p> <p>Adding detail</p> <p>Look at these possible questions about university life and see how I add detail each time. More detail leads to more specific language. That&rsquo;s good for vocabulary.</p> <p>Start with a simple general answer first</p>\n<p>Make your answer personal and think about your personal experience</p>\n<p>As you&rsquo;re speaking, just try and be more precise when you say something general</p>\n<p>What do you study?</p> <p>I&rsquo;m majoring in English but I&rsquo;m also doing French as my minor and taking one or two optional courses in Spanish. We spend most of our time on literature but there are also some modules in language too.</p> <p>Why did you choose to study that?</p> <p>I chose law because I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be a barrister. It&rsquo;s been my ambition since I was in 8th grade when I we had a day in court and I was fascinated by the whole process and I just knew I wanted help defend the innocent.</p> <p>What do you like about your course?</p> <p>I most enjoy it when we get to work in the labs.</p> <p>Talking about different times</p> <p>These are the same questions &ndash; I just answer them differently because this time I&rsquo;m thinking about different times. This can give you more to say but also can help your grammar by showing that you can use different tenses.</p> <p>Answer the question in the tense it is asked in first</p>\n<p>Think about other times too. What about last year/ Next year?</p>\n<p>What do you study?</p> <p>I&rsquo;m currently doing a masters at Nottingham Uni &ndash; it&rsquo;s in Biomechanical Engineering. But I&rsquo;ve only been doing that for a couple of months now. Before that I was at Shanghai Central University where I did my first degree in engineering.</p> <p>Why did you choose to study that?</p> <p>I chose computer science because that was the subject I was best at in school and I had the right grades to get to university. I had wanted to become a doctor when I was little because my dad is a neurosurgeon but then</p> <p>What do you like about your course?</p> <p>Writing essays and doing research! When I was at school I used to hate having to write essays but it&rsquo;s really different now when I have to write a paper at uni. I get to do my own research and I don&rsquo;t just have to repeat all the notes I made class like in school.</p> <p>Giving a reason</p> <p>Here are the same questions again. This time I concentrate on extending my answer in a different way &ndash; giving a reason. Note you can do this even when you don&rsquo;t hear the question &ldquo;why?&rdquo;. To extend your answer further, see if you can explain your reason. Don&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;because&rdquo;.</p> <p>Answer the question</p>\n<p>Give a reason with because</p>\n<p>Explain the reason</p>\n<p>What do you study?</p> <p>I&rsquo;m actually studying to be a dentist. I chose to do dentistry because it&rsquo;s a good career and pays well and the hours aren&rsquo;t quite as demanding as being a doctor &ndash; which was my other option. My career and financial security matter quite a lot to me.</p> <p>Why did you choose to study that?</p> <p>I decided to study economics because I my goal is to run my own business one day. It&rsquo;s an ambitious goal I know but I really want to be independent and not have to work for a giant corporation. And knowing about finance is the best way to get there I think.</p> <p>What do you like about your course?</p> <p>I suppose it&rsquo;s the experiments in the labs. That&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t really enjoy the reading and essay writing at all and I chose to do science because I&rsquo;m interested in seeing how things work &ndash; or don&rsquo;t work &ndash; in practice.</p> <p>Try some more practice questions about university life</p> <p>Have a go at giving your own answers to the question above and then try these questions. Remember the idea is not to get one perfect answer but to experiment and see what different answers you can give.</p> <p>What do you like about your course?</p> <p>Is there anything you dislike about your course?</p> <p>What is the most interesting thing about what you study?</p> <p>Do you study in a group or alone?</p> <p>What are your career plans?</p>",

You&rsquo;ll almost certainly overrun or finish too quickly at first but the more you practise the sooner you&rsquo;ll get a feel for the time available.</p> <p>And remember, we often feel nervous when presenting and this can often lead to us speaking too quickly. Try not to rush. Regular pauses between sentences will help you control the pace of your talk and the examiner will find it easier to follow what you&rsquo;re saying.</p> <p>You can find out more about structuring short talks and using pauses for effect in IELTS Speaking Advanced.</p>",

Use other &lsquo;question&rsquo; prompts</p> <p>These are question prompts:</p> <p>Who</p>\n<p>What</p>\n<p>When</p>\n<p>Where</p>\n<p>How</p>\n<p>Why</p>\n<p>When you prepare, write down the other question prompts that are not on the list, and think of things you can say about those as well.</p> <p>For example:</p> <p>When - When did you meet?</p>\n<p>Where &ndash; Where did you meet?</p> <p>2. Think of a Story</p> <p>You can also tell a story about the person, place, event or thing you are discussing.</p> <p>So in your one minute, think of and note down a quick and preferably interesting story to tell about the topic.</p> <p>You can tell the story anywhere in your IELTS speaking part 2, as long as it fits in.</p> <p>  </p>\n<p>Example IELTS Speaking Part 2 :</p> <p>The person I&rsquo;m going to talk about today is my teacher from high school. (who) Her name was Miss Chadwick and she taught quite a few subjects at the school. She had been working there for quite a few years when I met her I think. (where) We met for the first time in my English class. (more about &lsquo;who&rsquo;) I remember this well because she was quite young compared to most of the other teachers in the school so I was surprised that she was a teacher! In fact she looked more like she could be one of the older students!</p> <p>(How long) So I met her when I was 15, and that was 10 years ago. I don&rsquo;t actually know her anymore as we lost contact soon after I left the school, but I still remember her very well for several reasons. (What qualities) Firstly, she was very kind. She always treated all the students very well in the class, and I can&rsquo;t remember her ever shouting at anyone. Also, she had a really good sense of humour. She would make jokes in the class which most of the other teachers never did. The other teachers were very serious all the time. And she made the classes a lot of fun and very interesting, something that I think is very important otherwise you start to get bored. Oh, and also she explained things very well and very clearly. Often teachers are not able to do this in a way that students can understand, especially when it's complicated subjects.</p> <p>So those are the qualities that she had. (why such an influence) The reason she had such an important influence on me is because I was quite a shy person at school and not very confident, but she helped me to change this. (tell a story) Each year, there was a school play that would be held in front of all the parents, and that year, when I was 15, Miss Chadwick was organizing and directing the play. I really didn't want to be in it because I was so shy, but Miss Chadwick insisted that I take one of the roles, and it was one of the main roles which meant that I would have to do a lot of speaking! I was so nervous. Anyway, I went ahead and did it, and on the night I did really well and really enjoyed it. And that really boosted my confidence and this has helped me to this day.</p> <p>So my teacher Miss Chadwick is the person who has influenced my life and I will never forget her.</p>",

You are given 1 minute to plan what you will say and are allowed to make notes (just key ideas).</p> <p>Here is an example topic cue card from ielts.org:</p> <p>Describe something you own that is very important to you.</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>Where you got it from</p>\n<p>How long you have had it</p>\n<p>What you use it for</p>\n<p>And explain why it is important to you.</p> <p>Rounding off questions:</p> <p>Is it valuable in terms of money?</p>\n<p>Would it be easy to replace?</p> <p>  </p>\n<p>Tips:</p> <p>Use your preparation time wisely. Read the instructions on the cue card carefully and use the 3 sub-topic points to guide you</p>\n<p>Underline key words that strike you as important &ndash; for example, &ldquo;describe&rdquo;, &ldquo;own&rdquo;, &ldquo;Important&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Quickly decide what &ldquo;thing&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll talk about</p>\n<p>Jot down some key ideas that answer sub-topic points</p>\n<p>Remember the key word in the directions, which is DESCRIBE &ndash; so start off with describing the object &ndash; describe shape, size, color, how it functions, what it is used for, etc.</p>\n<p>Remember, you need to keep talking until the examiner asks you to stop and may ask you a related follow-up question (rounding off question as listed on the cue card). As you have the rounding off questions on the cue card, be prepared to answer those as well.</p>\n<p>Be careful with your VERB TENSE. If you&rsquo;re describing something &ndash; it&rsquo;s a statement of fact so you use PRESENT SIMPLE. If you&rsquo;re describing something you had in the past and no longer have, use PAST SIMPLE. If you&rsquo;re talking about long you have owned something, use PRESENT PERFECT (have + past participle).</p> <p>  </p> <p>Some useful phrases to introduce your topic:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to talk about &hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to talk about &hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Rephrase the question: &ldquo;The most important thing I own is &hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Some useful phrases to explain how you feel:</p>\n<p>The reason why it&rsquo;s important to me is because . . .</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to me because . . .</p>\n<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p>\n<p>Here are some other sample task questions for you practice:</p>\n<p>Describe a place you have lived in that you particularly liked.</p>\n<p>You should say:</p>\n<p>when you lived there</p>\n<p>who you lived with</p>\n<p>what was most memorable about this place</p>\n<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p>\n<p>Describe a job that you would like to do in the future.</p>\n<p>You should say:</p>\n<p>why you are attracted to this job</p>\n<p>how much training, if any, would be necessary</p>\n<p>what kind of personal qualities it would require</p>\n<p>&mdash;-</p>\n<p>Describe a skill you learned successfully</p>\n<p>You should say:</p>\n<p>what skill you learned</p>\n<p>when and where you learned it</p>\n<p>how you learned it</p>\n<p>and explain what helped you to learn it successfully.</p>",

        "content": "<p>How should you use your one minute&rsquo;s thinking time in part 2 speaking? Perhaps the best thing to do is to make sure that you just select the right thing to talk about and don&rsquo;t concentrate so much on making notes. That may sound scary but it can really help you get to two minutes.</p> <p>Key ideas</p> <p>The key ideas are</p> <p>The first thing you think of may not be what you can talk most about</p>\n<p>It can help to think about different things to talk about and then select the best</p>\n<p>Sometimes you may waste time writing notes rather than just thinking</p>\n<p>The only notes you should make are notes that actually help you speak better!</p>\n<p>An example of selecting the right thing</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s start with the example to illustrate the skill. Here&rsquo;s a tough question</p> <p>Talk about a piece of furniture you like. You should say</p> <p>what it is</p> <p>where it is</p> <p>how often you use it</p> <p>and say why you like it so much</p> <p>This is the first thing I think of:</p> <p>  </p> <p>It&rsquo;s a chair that I have from my mother. One problem: I can&rsquo;t think of very much to say about it. I can just about describe it but that&rsquo;s it. Even though it&rsquo;s my favourite and the first thing I think of, it&rsquo;s not going to be the best thing to talk about.</p> <p>The next piece of furniture I think of is this sofa. I quite like it. I have more to say about it, but again I can only describe it and say it&rsquo;s slightly uncomfortable and I use it to watch tv.</p> <p>  </p> <p>Now this piece of furniture I can say lots about.</p> <p>  </p> <p>It isn&rsquo;t my favourite but it has an interesting story and I know can extend my answer when I talk about it. Here are the ideas I have with the brief notes I make.</p> <p>it&rsquo;s a chair I bought for my daughter &ndash; daughter</p> <p>it looks slightly odd &ndash; appearance</p> <p>I kept it in the garage for months &ndash; garage</p> <p>it&rsquo;s now loved by my daughter and cat! &ndash; cat</p> <p>it doesn&rsquo;t fit with my other furniture &ndash; different</p> <p>The point is that it&rsquo;s the third thing I think of. If I decide too quickly to talk about my mother&rsquo;s chair and make notes on that I may only speak for a minute or so. If I spend a few moments thinking of options, then I will get more to say.</p> <p>How to make it work</p> <p>This is a technique you&rsquo;ll need to practise for yourself to see what works for you. But here are some ideas to start you off.</p> <p>Don&rsquo;t automatically make notes on the first thing you think of</p> <p>Often people fail to get to 2 minutes because they choose the wrong thing to talk about. If you instantly decide on what you&rsquo;re going to cover then you may waste your preparation time. Be prepared to stop and think a bit</p> <p>Take a little time to choose</p> <p>Obviously you don&rsquo;t have a lot of time to do this. That doesn&rsquo;t mean, however, that you should spend no time on it! Spending a few seconds choosing the right thing won&rsquo;t be time wasted.</p> <p>Think about different options</p> <p>If you&rsquo;re going to use this technique, then this bit should be obvious. In order to select the best thing to talk about you think about different options and decide which you can say most about. In my example above I&rsquo;m sure I can speak about my daughter&rsquo;s chair</p> <p>Choose something you have more to say about</p> <p>Again this part should be obvious. There is a trap though. Lots of questions ask you to talk about something you like or dislike. The trap is that you try and talk about the thing you like or dislike most. In the example above that would mean my talking about my mother&rsquo;s chair. Instead I suggest that you consider:</p> <p>the number of thing you can say</p> <p>what you know best</p> <p>You can still make notes!</p> <p>While this technique is essentially a thinking technique, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t still make a few notes. If you look at my example above, you&rsquo;ll see that I have made a few one word notes to help me remind myself of things I can say.</p> <p>Look at all the parts of the question</p> <p>This point is slightly different. Part 2 questions come in 4 parts and you are asked to cover all 4. While there is no task response score in speaking, it is generally best to try and cover all the questions. They&rsquo;re really there to help you. The idea is that if you look at all the parts of the question before you start speaking, then it should be much easier to decide whether you have enough to say.</p> <p>Go beyond the question &ndash; think of comparisons and history</p> <p>This point is slightly different again. You can go beyond the question in part 2 as well &ndash; you&rsquo;re not restricted to just talking about the points in the question. In fact, its quite natural to add detail that isn&rsquo;t asked for. Here&rsquo;s an example of how it can work where I add in lots of detail about another chair.</p> <p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you about a chair that I bought for my daughter. She&rsquo;s a toddler now and when she was just a baby I bought her a bouncy chair for her to sleep in. It was a great success and she used to love bouncing up and down in it. The only problem was that she got too big for it and I had to buy her a new one. It&rsquo;s that chair I&rsquo;m going to tell you about.</p> <p>If you&rsquo;re stuck for things to say a neat trick is to compare the thing you&rsquo;re talking about with something else. Here i compare my daughter&rsquo;s chair with my mother&rsquo;s chair. I&rsquo;m able to do that partly because I spent a little time thinking of different bits of furniture before I started speaking.</p> <p>Why do I like this chair so much? Well, it isn&rsquo;t my favourite piece of furniture. That would be an antique armchair I inherited from my mother &ndash; it&rsquo;s a much more elegant and stylish chair. But when it comes down to it, I get more pleasure from my daughter&rsquo;s chair because it makes her smile and what makes her smile makes me happy.</p>",

So how important is it to be accurate and should you try to self-correct any mistakes you make?</p> <p>The fact that you have a good level of English will certainly be an asset and the interviewer will be reassured if you can speak clearly and reasonably accurately. Self-correction is a good way of showing the interviewer that you&rsquo;re aware of having made a mistake. However, don&rsquo;t go mad trying to correct each and every error! Remember, you should also be demonstrating your fluency skills as well. Monitoring your speech TOO closely and self-correcting every mistake will slow you down and make you sound rather hesitant.</p> <p>Remember this: the interviewer will be interested in WHAT you have to say as well as how you say it so try to concentrate on this fact and worry less about speaking &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; English!</p>",

What is wrong with the 'bad' answers?</p> <p>Example 1</p>\n<p>Describe the type of food that people eat in your country.</p> <p>Bad answer:</p> <p>I might try some other dishes occasionally, such as Korean food as I like that, but I always tend to eat Japanese food. At home my mum will always make Japanese food too. My brother will eat much more western food than I do, but he will go out to buy this rather than getting it at home.</p> <p>Good answer:</p> <p>There are a lot of different types of food in Japan if you are in big cities like Tokyo, such fast food outlets, Italian restaurants, Korean food, and of course a lot of Japanese restaurants. But most local people tend to eat Japanese food, even in these big cities when there are other choices, but especially in smaller towns and villages.</p> <p>Example 2</p> <p>What do you think about the way languages are taught in schools in your country?</p> <p>Bad answer:</p> <p>In my school we learned English and it was taught really badly. I think it's firstly because the teachers themselves were not native English people, and their English was not perfect. So they taught us to say some things incorrectly, and also they could not always say things clearly so we could not learn good pronunciation off them.</p> <p>Good answer:</p> <p>In most schools in my country, English is the main language taught. I think it is actually taught quite badly because many of the teachers are not native English teachers. A good example is at my school. The teachers themselves were nearly all Korean, not native English people, and their English was not perfect. So they taught us to say some things incorrectly, and also they could not always say things clearly so we could not learn good pronunciation off them.</p> <p>  </p> <p>As you will have noticed, in the bad answers, the candidate just speaks about their personal experience and nothing general. In the good answer, the candidate talks about society in general.</p>\n<p>However, this does not mean that you cannot refer to your own experiences, but this should be done to illustrate your general response in order to further explain what you mean.</p> <p>So to sum up, in part 3 of the speaking, make sure that you are talking generally rather than about personal experiences.</p>\n<p>However, you can use personal experiences, but these should just be used to illustrate your general points.</p>\n<p>  </p>",

We can use &lsquo;going to&rsquo; to talk about a plan we have, but in the IELTS test part 3 we usually use it when we are making a prediction based on evidence we know of, often from what we can see in front of us.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Going to&rsquo; is followed by verb 1, or the infinitive.</p>\n<p>The sky is very black (the evidence we can see). I think it&rsquo;s going to rain. (not an IELTS example)</p>\n<p>The internet is getting much easier to use and safer (the evidence), so I think it&rsquo;s going to be very popular for buying clothes in the future.</p>\n<p>The climate is going to become warmer and warmer because the government is not doing enough to prevent global warming.</p>\n<p>Will or going to?</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Will&rsquo; is more common for giving predictions about future events, so if you are unsure of the difference between them, just use &lsquo;will&rsquo;.</p> <p>However, we often use will and going to inter-changeably. For example, in the sentences above we can swap them without affecting the meaning:</p>\n<p>The climate will / is going to become warmer and warmer because the government is not doing enough to prevent global warming.</p>\n<p>Education will probably / is probably going to be more important in the future because as populations increase, there will be greater competition for jobs.</p> <p>  </p>\n<p>Modal Verbs</p>\n<p>In addtion to will and going to, another way to talk about the future is to use modal verbs such as &lsquo;may&rsquo; and &lsquo;might&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>Again, these are used when you are not certain about something.

For example, we&rsquo;ve seen many book shops close down because people can buy online at cheaper prices from sites such as Amazon. It makes life much easier if products can be delivered direct to our door, especially with our busy modern lifestyles. I think this will only increase in the future as more people feel safe to buy online and online shops make it easier to purchase this way. Also, I think our lives are only going to become busier, so more people will choose to shop this way.</p>",

To do this, paraphrase the title of the graph, making sure you put in a time frame if there is one.<br><br>\n\nHere is an example for the above line graph:<br><br>\n\n<b>The line graph compares the fast food consumption of teenagers in Australia between 1975 and 2000, a period of 25 years.<br>\nYou can see this says the same thing as the title, but in a different way. <br><br></b>\n\n<b>2) Give an Overview<br><br></b>\n\nYou also need to state what the main trend or trends in the graph are. Don’t give detail such as data here – you are just looking for something that describes what is happening overall.<br><br>\n\nOne thing that stands out in this graph is that one type of fast food fell over the period, whilst the other two increased, so this would be a good overview.<br><br>\n\nHere is an example:<br><br>\n\n<b>Overall, the consumption of fish and chips declined over the period, whereas the amount of pizza and hamburgers that were eaten increased.<br>\nThis covers the main changes that took place over the whole period.<br></b>\n\nYou may sometimes see this overview as a conclusion. It does not matter if you put it in the conclusion or the introduction when you do an IELTS writing task 1, but you should provide an overview in one of these places. <br><br>\n\n\n<b>3) Give the Detail<br><br></b>\n\nYou can now give more specific detail in the body paragraphs.<br><br>\n\nWhen you give the detail in your body paragraphs in your IELTS writing task 1, you must make reference to the data.<br><br>\n\nThe key to organizing your body paragraphs for an IELTS writing task 1 is to <b>group data</b> together where there are <b>patterns</b>.<br><br>\n\nTo do this you need to identify any similarities and differences.<br><br>\n\nLook at the graph – what things are similar and what things are different?<br><br>\n\nAs we have already identified in the overview, the consumption of fish and chips declined over the period, whereas the amount of pizza and hamburgers that were eaten increased.<br><br>\n\nSo it is clear that pizza and hamburgers were following a similar pattern, but fish and chips were different. On this basis, you can use these as your ‘groups’, and focus one paragraph on fish and chip and the other one on pizza and hamburgers.<br><br>\n\nHere is an example of the first paragraph:<br><br>\n\n<b>In 1975, the most popular fast food with Australian teenagers was fish and chips, being eaten 100 times a year. This was far higher than Pizza and hamburgers, which were consumed approximately 5 times a year. However, apart from a brief rise again from 1980 to 1985, the consumption of fish and chips gradually declined over the 25 year timescale to finish at just under 40.</b><br><br>\n\nAs you can see, the focus is on fish and chips. This does not mean you should not mention the other two foods, as you should still make comparisons of the data as the questions asks.<br><br>\n\nThe second body then focuses on the other foods:<br><br>\n<b>\nIn sharp contrast to this, teenagers ate the other two fast foods at much higher levels. Pizza consumption increased gradually until it overtook the consumption of fish and chips in 1990. It then levelled off from 1995 to 2000. The biggest rise was seen in hamburgers as the occasions they were eaten increased sharply throughout the 1970’s and 1980’s, exceeding that of fish and chips in 1985. It finished at the same level that fish and chips began, with consumption at 100 times a year. </b>",

You may come up with reasons for an increase in crime such as ‘lack of parental supervision’ and ‘boredom’.<br><br>\nHowever, I have seen students come up with problems of teenage crime, such as ‘more young people being put in prison' and ‘stress for their parents'.<br><br>\nThis particular task asks you to write about ‘reasons’, not ‘problems’(though being asked to write about 'problems and solutions' is common).<br><br>\nSo if you do this you will not be answering the question. This comes from rushing and not taking enough time to identify the task properly.<br><br>\n<b>Other Question Types</b><br><br>\nThe previous question was fairly easy, so to identify the task was hopefully not too difficult.<br><br>\nSome questions, though, will take more thought in order to identify what you need to write about.<br><br>\nHere is another example:<br><br>\n<b>Advances in technology and automation have reduced the need for manual labour. Therefore, working hours should be reduced.<br>\nTo what extent do you agree?<br></b><br>\nAgain, look to the end of the prompt to identify the task.<br><br>\nYou have to say if you agree or disagree with working hours being reduced, or, in other words, automation (machines) taking over from some human’s duties.<br><br>\nYou must also say how much you agree or disagree (\"to what extent\").<br><br>\nLet’s assume you want to look at both sides of the issue. You therefore need to discuss the reasons why you agree, and the reasons why you disagree. Or put another way:<br><br>\nThe advantages of reducing working hours<br>\nThe disadvantages of reducing working hours<br><br>\nAnd of course in the introduction or conclusion you need to make it clear what your opinion is.<br><br>\nIf you do all of these things then you will have answered all parts of the prompt. If you find more reasons to agree than disagree, then you can write more about this side of the argument, or visa versa.",

The better your writing coherence, the easier it will be to follow your arguments in your essay. <br><br>\nOne important point though before we go on. If you <b>over use transitions</b> they can make your writing look slightly <b>mechanical</b> as very good writers will need to use them less as they will have the ability to cleverly guide someone through their writing without them.<br><br>\n\nIt is quite a high level skill though. So it really depends on your ability. If you are at a lower level of writing, you should make more use of them as they will make it easy for the examiner to follow your ideas.<br><br>\n\nIf you have more sophistication in your writing, you may not want to use them too much or it could affect your style.<br><br>\nIf you are unsure, it probably means you need to be using them! We'll now go on to look further at how some of them are used.<br><br>\nMost of these transition words are used in the same way in sentences and are followed by a subject and verb.<br><br>\n<b>Varying Position and Use of Transition Words</b><br><br>\nHowever, you do not want to use these words too ‘mechanically’ so you should vary their position, and don’t repeat the same word too often. You can vary the position with the following transitions:<br><br>\n <br>\n<b>1) Giving Examples</b><br><br>\nYou can vary your use of ‘for example’ and ‘for instance’ by moving them to after the first phrase of the sentence or to after the subject or verb.<br><br>\n<b>\n&ensp;There are many ways to improve congestion.  Some cities in The Netherlands, for instance, have pedestrian only city centres.<br><br>\n&ensp;There are many ways to improve congestion.  Some cities in The Netherlands have, for instance, pedestrian only city centres.<br></b><br>\n<b>2) Giving a Contrast or Result</b><br><br>\n\nSimilarly, you can place contrast or result transitions further down the sentence:<br>\n\n&ensp;Tokyo now has a Sky Train.  Traffic problems, as a result/therefore/as a consequence, have decreased significantly.<br>\n<br>\n&ensp;These can also be joined to the previous sentence with the conjunction 'and’:<br><br>\n&ensp;Tokyo now has a Sky Train, and, as a result/therefore/as a consequence, traffic problems have decreased significantly.<br>\n<br>\nNote: you cannot join it to another sentence without ’and’:<br><br>\n&ensp;Tokyo now has a Sky Train, as a result, traffic problems  have decreased significantly.  - this is incorrect.<br>\n <br>\n3) <b>Listing Points</b><br>\nThese can also be varied.  For example:<br><br>\n&ensp;Firstly, an advantage of a new public transport system is that it will reduce traffic congestion.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, to improve your writing, you should vary the way you use these.  They can be changed so they are no longer a transition but become part of the subject:<br>\n&ensp;The first advantage of a new public transport system is that it will reduce traffic congestion.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis lesson has shown how you can use transitions to improve your writing coherence.<br>\nMake sure you find out more about these transitions so you know how to use them correctly, then practice using them in your writing.<br>",

When you write an introduction, you should make sure you do two things:<br>\n<br>\n&ensp;Write a sentence introducing the topic and giving some background facts about it <br>\n<br>\n&ensp;Tell the reader what you are going to be writing about<br><br>\n\nHow you do this will vary depending on the question, but here is an example:<br>\n<br>\n<b>Example 1:</b><br><br>\nQuestion:<br><br>\n\nBlood sports have become a hot topic for debate in recent years.

Blood sports should be banned.<br>\nTo what extent to you agree or disagree?<br><br>\n\nSample IELTS essay introduction:<br><br>\n&ensp;Despite the fact that killing animals for sport is popular in modern society, it remains a contentious issue. I believe that blood sports are cruel and uncivilized and so should be banned as soon as possible.<br><br>\n\nAs you can see, the <b>first sentence</b> consists of the topic plus somebackground facts on the topic which have been taken from the rubric.<br><br>\n\nThe second sentence then gives the writers opinion and tells us that in the essay the writer will be arguing the reasons why it is cruel.<br>\nThe topic does not have to be in the first sentence, but it should be made clear somewhere in the introduction. You must always have a thesis.<br>\n<br>\n\n<b>Paraphrasing</b><br><br>\n\nAnother important point - <b>don't copy from the question!</b> You must paraphrase (put it in your own words). To do this you can use synonyms and move the order of the sentence around.<br><br>\n\nUsing some of the same words is acceptable, but <b>don't copy whole phrases.</b><br><br>\n\nYou can see how the question above has been paraphrased.

So it is not enough just to put lots of ideas down - fewer ideas are better that are explained properly with reasons and examples.<br><br>\n\nLook at some model essays to see how a clear position is presented throughout and how only a few ideas are presented but they are fully explained and supported.<br>\n<br>\n\n<b>Coherence and Cohesion</b><br><br>\n\nVery basically, this is how you <b>organize and present your ideas</b>, and how <b>easy your work is to read</b>.<br><br>\n\nSo you will need to know how to organize an essay properly in terms of paragraphing and having ideas that logically and clearly go from one to the next to get an IELTS band 7.<br><br>\n\nAnother key point here is that you have to have a <b>clear central topic within each paragraph</b>.<br><br>\n\nTo take a simple example, if you are writing about the advantages and disadvantages of something, then you may want to have one paragraph about each. Each paragraph will then have a clear central topic - either advantages or disadvantages.<br><br>\n\nIf you mix them up, this may not be clear.<br><br>\n\nAgain, look at some of the model essays to see how each body paragraph clearly has one central topic.<br><br>\n\nYou also need a mix of cohesive devices. These are the things that join and link your ideas, sentences and paragraphs. For example,transitions such as 'however', 'firstly', 'moreover', and other general linking words within sentences such as 'and' and 'because'.<br>\n\n<br>You will need a variety and mix of these for an IELTS band 7, and you'll need to be able to use them effectively with some flexibilityrather than mechanically.<br>\n<br>\n\n<b>Lexical Resource</b><br><br>\n\nYour lexis is basically your <b>vocabulary</b>, and as it says in the descriptors, you'll need to show that you know some <b>less common words</b> and be able to use them precisely.<br>\n\nIts in the accuracy that is needed for your vocabulary that problems can often occur with regards to getting an IELTS band 7.<br><br>\n\nAs you can see, you can only make occasional errors in your word choice, word formation and spelling. This means the majority need to be correct!<br><br>\n\nThis is obviously no easy achievement and so you'll need to be a fairly skilled writer to be making only occasional errors with your lexis.<br><br>\n\nYou can find some useful and less common vocabulary by following this link, but you need to learn how to use the words correctly otherwise you may make more mistakes with word forms.<br><br>\n\nUsing lots of new words that you don't know how to use properly could make your writing worse, so be careful! Only use words you know how to use properly.<br>\n<br>\n\n<b>Grammatical Range and Accuracy</b><br><br>\n\nAs will be clear from the title, this one is assessing your level of grammar.<br><br>\n\nYou will need to show you can use a wide range of sentence structures and have a high level of accuracy.<br><br>\n\nJust having a few complex sentences with words such as 'because', 'if' and 'although' may not be enough. You'll need to have an awareness of some more complex structures.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, like the lexis, this can often be where students struggle to get an IELTS band 7. You need to have frequent error-free sentences.<br>\n<br>\nIn other words, the majority of your sentences can't have grammar errors. This is not easy, so like with the lexis, you will need to be a fairly skilled writer.<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<b>Some final tips...</b><br><br>\n\nThis lesson then has shown you how to get an IELTS band 7 in your writing, or what is required.<br><br>\n\nUnfortunately there is no magic bullet that is suddenly going to move you up a band. But there may be things you can improve on that will help if you think you are making errors in what what is needed in the criteria.<br><br>\n\nFor example, are you always spending some time at the beginning <b>analyzing the question</b> carefully to make sure you are answering all parts of it and <b>writing a plan / outline?</b><br>\n<br>\nIf not, you may be making errors by not fully answering the question or by not organizing your essay or ideas well.<br>\n<br>\nMost of my students that I check are failing to get the majority of the sentences error-free or the majority of the lexis correct. So this may well be where you are falling down if you are getting a 6.5.<br>\n<br>\nIn this case you'll need to work on <b>improving your grammar</b> andchecking your work very carefully for mistakes. If you have a writing teacher obviously this will help as they can check your work.<br>\n<br>\nBut again, <b>planning first can help</b> with this because if you plan then you will be able to write quicker. You will then have more time to be more careful and more time to check your grammar and lexis whilst you write and at the end.",

        "content": "This lesson will give you the basic tips on paragraph writing.<br><br>\n\nYou should follow the same structure that you would for writing any paragraph when you write an IELTS paragraph, though it may be shorter because of the limited time that you have.<br><br>\n\nThis limited time and space means that you have to get your ideas across as clearly and succinctly as possible.<br>\n<br>\nIf you have planned well before you write, then you should be well on your way to being able to write your paragraphs quickly and clearly.<br>\n<br>\nThe following has all the components of a good paragraph. <br>\n<br>\nRead it through and identify why this is.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Studying Abroad</b><br>\n<br>\nStudying abroad has two main benefits.  Firstly, people who study abroad can get a better job when they return to their home country.  This is because their qualifications and experience mean that they tend to get jobs that are higher paid, and they can also gain promotion quickly. Another advantage of studying abroad is the independence students can gain. For example, students have to cope with the challenges of living alone and meeting new people from different cultures.  As a consequence, they will become more confident in their life and in their relationships with others.  All in all, it is clear that studying abroad is a beneficial experience.<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<b>The Three Parts to Good Paragraph Writing</b><br><br>\n\nThe 'text book' structure for a paragraph is as follows:<br><br>\n\n&ensp;Topic sentence<br>\n&ensp;Supporting sentences<br>\n&ensp;Concluding sentence<br><br>\n\n<b>1. Topic Sentence</b><br><br>\n\nThe <b>topic sentence</b> states what the paragraph will be about.  It gives the topic of the paragraph, and it also restricts the topic to one or two main ideas which can be explained fully in the space of one paragraph.  The controlling idea is the specific area that the topic is limited to:<br><br>\n\ntopic         <->         controlling idea<br><br>\n\nStudying abroad has two main benefits<br><br>\n\n<b>2. Supporting Sentences</b><br><br>\n\n<b>Supporting sentences</b> explain and develop the topic sentence.  Specifically, they discuss the topic sentence by explaining the main ideas and discussing those more fully using reasons, examples, facts, results, statistics, or anything else that proves your ideas are true. <br><br>\n\nThe supporting sentences that explain the benefits of studying abroad are:<br><br>\n\nPeople get a better job when they return home (1st supporting idea)<br><br>\n\nBetter qualifications & experience mean better pay and promotion (reason)<br>\nNow has a high standard of living (result)<br><br>\n\nStudents gain independence (2nd supporting idea)<br><br>\n\nStudents have to cope with the challenges of living alone and meeting new people from different cultures.(example)<br>\nStudents will become more confident in their life and relationships (result)<br><br>\n\n<b>3. Concluding Sentence (Optional)</b><br><br>\n\nA concluding sentence can be used to signal the end of the paragraph. It tells the reader the important points to remember.  It is often a paraphrase of the topic sentence.<br><br>\n\n&ensp;&ensp;All in all, it is clear that studying abroad is a beneficial experience.<br><br>\n\nConcluding sentences are optional and paragraphs often do not have them.  You won't get marked down if you do not have a concluding sentence in IELTS, but it is a good way to add coherence to your paragraph.<br>\n<br>\n\n<b>Unity and Coherence</b><br><br>\n\nFor good paragraph writing, there must also be unity and coherence. The examiner will assess your IELTS paragraphs on their unity and coherence, which is clearly shown in the IELTS public band descriptors under \"Coherence and Cohesion\" for what is required for a band 7:<br><br>\n\n&ensp;&ensp;logically organises information and ideas; there is clear progression throughout<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;uses a range of cohesive devices appropriately<br>\n&ensp;&ensp;presents a clear central topic within each paragraph<br><br>\n\n<b>1. Unity</b><br><br>\n\nUnity means that you discuss only one main (central) topic area in a paragraph.  The area that you are going to cover is usually introduced in the topic sentence, and your supporting sentences should only be used to develop that. <br><br>\n\nFor the topic sentence above, you could discuss only two benefits of studying abroad.  You could not discuss three benefits, or start discussing the disadvantages of studying abroad.  If you did, your paragraph would not have unity.<br><br>\n\nEven if there is no specific topic sentence (more advanced writers do not always have an obvious topic sentence), the paragraph should still have one central topic area so it retains unity.<br><br>\n\n<b>2. Coherence</b><br><br>\n\nAnother element of good paragraph writing is coherency. This means your paragraph is easy to understand and read because<br>\n(a) The supporting sentences are arranged in a logical order and  <br>\n(b) The ideas are joined by appropriate transition signals.<br><br>\n\n(a) Logical Order<br><br>\n\nFor example, in the paragraph about studying abroad, there are two main ideas: People who study abroad can get a better job, and they will become more independent.   Each of these ideas is discussed, one after the other, with examples, reasons and results to support them.  This is logical order.<br><br>\n\n(b) Transition Signals<br><br>\n\nFurthermore, the relationship between the ideas is clearly shown by using appropriate transition words and phrases such as first of all, for instance, the result of this, another advantage,  as a consequence, all in all.    Using such words and phrases will guide the reader through your paragraph, making it coherent and, therefore, easy to understand.",

Discuss ONE opinion</b><br><br>\n\nAdvances in technology and automation have reduced the need for manual labour. (opinion)Therefore, working hours should be reduced.<br>\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?<br><br>\n\nWith these essays you are normally given ONE opinion, and then asked specifically if you agree or disagree with it, or to what extent you agree or disagree. You must make it clear whether you agree, disagree or partly agree and give your reasons why.<br>\n<br>\n<b><b>2. Discuss TWO OPPOSING opinions</b></b><br><br>\n\n&ensp;(opinion one) A growing number of people feel that animals should not be exploited by people and that they should have the same rights as humans,(opposing opinion) while others argue that humans must employ animals to satisfy their various needs, including uses for food and research.<br>\n<br>\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.<br>\n<br>\nWith these essays you have TWO opinions that oppose each other. You have to discuss BOTH of them and also give your opinion. Your essay will get a lower mark for 'task response' if you don’t discuss both of the opinions or you don’t make your opinion clear.<br>\n<br>\n<b>3. Advantages and Disadvantages</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>The number of old people around the world is increasing dramatically.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCould this have more positive or negative effects on society? or…<br>\n<br>\nDo the advantages of the trend outweigh the disadvantages? or…<br>\n<br>\nIs this a positive development?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nIn these questions you are given a fact or facts and then you have to look at the positive and negative sides of this. They are all asking for your opinion so you must state this. In the first two you will need to look at both sides as the question is clearly implying there are both positive and negative impacts.<br>\nDon't mix this up with a basic advantage and disadvantage essay like this:<br><br>\n<b>What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?</b><br><br>\nAlthough your organization, ideas and body paragraphs may be similar, this one is not asking for your opinion so you don't need to give it. It is simply asking you to present both sides of the issue.",

Most Task 2 questions will ask you to discuss or analyse an issue in terms of advantages/disadvantages and/or take a position by agreeing or disagreeing.

        "content": "This time the focus is on vocabulary. There is no magic bullet here – vocabulary learning takes time. That’s the bad news. What I do do though is to talk you through some of the more common problems with vocabulary in essays and give you some tips on avoiding them.<br><br>\n\nRead through this sample essay. It is well structured and addresses the question, but it is weak on vocab. Can you see what the problems are?<br><br>\n<i>\nWe live in a world where health and safety is more and more important One of the signs of this is the demand that dangerous sports should be banned. While I understand that argument, my view is that people should be free to do whatever sports they want.<br><br>\n\nThe biggest reason for objecting to extreme sports is that they can be very dangerous and can sometimes kill people. More than that, it is not just the sportspeople who are in danger, but spectators too can be badly injured. If, for example, a Formula 1 car crashes, the driver may be hurt and it is possible that people in the crowd will be too. Because of this danger, it is understandable why people want the government to ban these sports.<br><br>\n\nThe opposite argument is that people should be free to do whatever risk they want. So, if someone wants to jump out of a plane, then they should be allowed to and the government cannot say what they should do. Many dangerous sports are also not very risky and it is as dangerous doing everyday activities such as crossing the road or cooking a meal than bungee jumping.<br><br>\n\nI think that the government should regulate dangerous sports, but it should not ban them. It should also make certain that there is as little danger as possible because safety is the most important thing. This is most important for young children.</i><br><br>\n\n<b>Seeing the problems – unnecessary repetition</b><br><br>\n\nOne of the most common problems is you can get “stuck” on certain words. This frequently happens with words in the question itself. You will see my improved version retains has some repetition – there is less of it.<br><br>\n\nDon’t be afraid to repeat some words/phrases as that is good for the cohesion and coherence of your writing.<br><br>\n\n<b>Tip – think of vocabulary before you start writing</b><br><br>\n\nThe idea is quite simple. If you think of the words you want to use before you write, then you can use them. On the other hand, if you start writing too quickly, then it becomes much harder to try and vary your vocab.<br><br>\n\n<b>Tip – repetition should be on everyone’s editing checklist</b><br><br>\n\nOne of my top tips is that everyone should have a mental checklist of the type of errors they look for when they check their work – “I’m going to look for any mistake” doesn’t really work. The point here is that even the best writers can subconsciously get stuck on words and keep on repeating them if they are not careful.<br><br>\n\n<b>Tip – if you can’t find another word, repeat it in a different form</b><br><br>\n\nSometimes there is only one correct word. In this case, the best advice is not to find another word that may well be wrong, but to change the word slightly. This can mean using the noun form and not the verb form (ban becomes impose a ban on) or to qualify it with another word so ban becomes ban entirely.<br><br>\n\n<b>Tip – when you learn vocabulary, learn phrases and not just words</b><br><br>\n\nPart of solution to this problem is to learn phrases. For example, you are much more likely to be able to use “participate”, if you have first learnt the phrase “participate in a sport”.<br><br>\n\n<b>Finding solutions – think examples for precise language</b><br><br>\n\nThis is one of my favourite suggestions. The idea is that if you learn to use examples well, you get to use language that is precise and sometimes relatively simple. Take a look at this revised versions of the examples. the revisions may seem quite small, but I get to use precise language – a good thing.<br><br>\n\n<i>The counter argument is that people should be allowed to assume whatever risk they choose. So, if someone wishes to freefall from a plane at 30,000 feet, then they should be free to do so and it should be accepted that it is not the place of the government to dictate how they lead their lives. A further point is that in statistical terms there is a low probability of injury in many so-called dangerous sports and people are at greater risk carrying out everyday activities such as crossing the road or cooking a meal as bungee jumping.<br><br>\n\nThe principal reason for objecting to extreme sports is of course that they can be highly dangerous and sometimes life-threatening. More than that, it is not just the participants who are at risk, but spectators too can be seriously injured. If, for example, a Formula 1 car crashes, the driver may not escape unharmed and there is also a chance that a bouncing tyre or debris will fly into the crowd. Given this level of danger, it is understandable why people call for the authorities to take action.</i>",

        "content": "<b>Stage 1 – read and understand the question</b><br><br>\n\nMany “good’ essays go wrong simply because they don’t answer the question that is being asked. All IELTS essay questions have a precise question that needs to be answered. If you fail to give time to reading and understanding the question, you are most unlikely to answer it well. A possible problem here is that some candidates may come from an academic background where it is enough to write about the general topic within the question. That doesn’t work in IELTS. To avoid this common mistake simply make giving enough time to read and understand the question part of your writing routine.<br><br><br>\n\nCommon mistakes<br><br>\n\nYou get an essay topic, you have written before. You write the same answer. The question is different.<br>\nYou write about a general topic, not the question itself.<br>\nYou simply misunderstand what the question is asking you to do.<br><br>\n<b>Stage 2 – think – don’t just plan, really think</b><br><br>\n\nI could call this stage in the process “Plan”. Here I prefer the word “Think”. The danger with plans are that they may be ready-made and they may not fit the question in front of you. I prefer the word “Think” because it is more likely to get you looking at the question in front of you and deciding how you can answer it using your language, knowledge and experience at that moment. Part of the point is that you should treat each different essay as a new essay. You can borrow structures/ideas/language from essays you have written in the past, but you need to make certain they apply to the question in front of you. That means thinking: thinking not just about what to include but what not to include. Your ideas must link together to form a whole – that requires more thought.<br><br><br>\n\nCommon mistakes<br><br>\n\nThe ideas and examples are fine, they don’t relate to the question as it is asked<br>\nYou start writing and then half way through you realise that your essay doesn’t make sense – it’s too late to start over<br><br>\n \n\nThe writing process<br><br>\n\nI think it can help to divide the writing process into 3 to reflect the 3 parts of your essay. Each part of your essay does a different job to do, so why not treat each part of the essay as a different stage in the process?\n\n<b>Stage 3 – write an introduction – look both backwards and forwards</b>\n\nThe intro matters for various reasons. Not the least of these is that it is the first thing the examiner reads. Get it wrong and you have made an immediate bad impression. That’s not good. Another point to focus on in this part of the process is that the intro is the link between the question and your answer. In this stage of the process, I suggest you need to ensure that you are looking back at the question (to make sure that you are writing about the right thing) and forwards towards your answer (that anyone reading knows what you are talking about).<br><br>\n\nCommon problem to be avoided<br><br>\n\nYou don’t identify the question correctly<br>\nIt’s not clear what your position to the question is<br><br>\n<b>Stage 4 – develop your ideas in the main body – be clear about what you think and explain it</b><br><br>\n\nTo me, this stage of the process is slightly different and it requires you to think in a different way. The idea is that you don’t just need to give an answer to the question: the answer needs to be coherent. This largely means two things. Firstly, you need to make sure that your ideas are clear – one main idea per paragraph. You also need to be able to explain those ideas and show why/how they relate to the question.<br><br>\n\nCommon problems<br><br>\n\nThere’s too much detail and it isn’t clear what the main idea is<br>\nThe ideas aren’t supported with reasons and examples<br>\nThe ideas are good but they don’t relate to the question<br><br>\n<b>Stage 5 – summarise the ideas in your conclusion – make sure your essay is a whole</b><br><br>\n\nNo essay would be complete without a conclusion of course. The writing skill is slightly different here too. I would suggest that it is different because it is a reading then writing skill – you can’t very well write a conclusion until/unless you have read your essay. This is because your conclusion makes your essay complete by going back to the introduction and reflecting the question there and also looking back to the main body and picking out your main points there. It’sa different writing skill because you are trying to say as much as possible in only a few words – that is what a summary is!<br><br>\n\nCommon mistakes<br><br>\n\nsometimes the conclusion doesn’t get written – that means you haven’t written an essay<br>\nsometimes the conclusion doesn’t match the content of the essay – or, even worse, it doesn’t answer the question<br><br>\n<b>Stage 6 – go over what you wrote</b><br><br>\n\nThe reality of exam essays is that you only have one chance to get it right. You don’t have time to write it once and then improve it – as you would with a piece of real academic writing. That said, it is important to check what you write. My personal suggestion is that this stage of the process gets repeated during the entire writing stage – do not leave it to the end. That’s almost certainly too late.\n\n<b>A practice exercise – you can learn more from rewriting an old essay than writing a new essay</b><br><br>\n\nThis is boring perhaps but it is a real learning exercise. Find an essay you have already written. Write it again. The idea is not so much to correct mistakes in your old essay, it’s to be aware of the process of writing. It works to take an old essay because you already have ideas and words for it. You don’t have to worry so much about content (the what) more about the process (the how).\n\nConcentrate on each phase of the process – ask yourself the question “what I am trying to do now?”<br>\nDon’t worry about timing too much – it may even make sense to have a cup of tea between each stage",

        "content": "<p>The main body of your essay is the most important part and requires the most thought. In this lesson I give you some checklists of things to think about as you write, or before you write, the main paras. It is good to focus on what you are trying to do before you write,but there is a danger that you will &ldquo;confuse yourself&rdquo; if you try and think of too many things. If so, remember just this: your writing score is<br /><br /><strong>25% Task response</strong><br /><strong>25% Coherence and Cohesion</strong><br /><strong>25% Vocabulary</strong><br /><strong>25% Grammar</strong><br /><br />If you are well prepared, then that may be enough information. I would emphasise, however, that it still pays to <strong>stop before you write each paragraph and ask yourself how you will answer the task, be coherent and cohesive, use a range of vocab and write accurately. </strong> You might even do this before each sentence!<br /><br /><strong>Coherence &ndash; linking your thoughts</strong><br /><br />Coherence is how well your ideas link together and is the skill of making sense &ndash; it is something you should focus on as you write. In essays, it works at two levels and as you write you need to think about both of these:<br /><br />Do the paragraphs link together so that my essay makes sense.? This is a question of essay structure.<br />Do the sentences in the paragraphs link together so that the paragraphs make sense? This is a question of paragraph structure.<br /><br /><strong>Essay structure is coherence &ndash; decide on the role of paragraphs</strong><br /><br />Nearly all IELTS essays follow a simple structure. There are either going to be 4 or 5 paragraphs in all with 2 or 3 body paragraphs. These paragraphs will generally do one of 3 things: support each other by making the same point in a different way, say something that takes the opposite point of view or make a separate point altogether. This means that in the exam you have to answer 2 questions:<br /><br />How many paragraphs am I going to write?<br />Will those paragraphs support each other, take opposite views or make separate points<br /><br />My best suggestion when you think about the essay structure is that you <strong>don&rsquo;t worry about the type of essay you are writing: Opinion/Argument etc. You just answer those 2 questions.</strong> This is a simpler approach and there is always more than one way to answer a question. All you need to worry about is whether your approach is logical and answers the question in front of you.<br /><br /><strong>Essay structure is topic sentences too &ndash; identify the main points in your first/topic sentences</strong><br /><br />If you have planned well, you should already know your essay structure &ndash; particularly if you have drawn an essay map. All the same I do think it is wise to refocus on this as you begin each content paragraph. The goal is to make sure that what you are about to write does link back to the introduction. In practical terms, this means that you make sure that<strong> the first sentence in each paragraph clearly states what that paragraph is about</strong> and that idea is found in the introduction &ndash; these are the famous &ldquo;topic sentences&rdquo;.<br /><br />Top tip: Keep your topic sentences simple and to the point.Their function is not to say anything clever,just to say where you are in your argument.<br /><br /><strong>Paragraph structure is coherence</strong><br /><br />You also need to focus on making sure your paragraphs make sense. Again,this is where a good plan really can help. In practical terms, my suggestion here is that before you write each paragraph you should know how that paragraph finishes. If you write &ldquo;dynamically&rdquo; and simply keep on adding ideas, then there is every chance the ideas may not work together &ndash; no matter how good they are. Here is a quick checklist for you to look at before you write:<br /><br />Do I know the one main idea of the paragraph?<br />Do I know the structure of the paragraph?Am I going to list or explain one point more fully?<br />Am I clear about what is the main idea,what is a supporting reason and what is an example?<br />Do the reasons and examples support the main idea?<br /><br /><strong>Cohesion &ndash; linking your words</strong><br /><br />This is the twin of coherence &ndash; it is linking as well, but this time linking words rather than ideas. You will probably learn most about the skills of cohesion before the exam. That does not mean that you should forget it in the exam itself. Here are 2 practical things to think about that may help you write better:<br /><br />consider beginning each sentence with a linking idea &ndash; this need not be a word like &ldquo;Furthermore&rdquo;,often a pronoun like &ldquo;This&rdquo;works just as well<br />consider using synonyms and words of the same family to link your writing &ndash; this is a very practical idea because it will also help your vocabulary<br /><br /><strong>Grammar and Vocabulary</strong><br /><br />Oh yes, these matter too! You should of course make sure that you make as few mistakes as possible. It can though sometimes be a problem if you focus too hard on these as you write -particularly at lower levels if you worry about these too much either the essay doesn&rsquo;t get finished or it isn&rsquo;t coherent . Here are a few thoughts for you that may be practical in the exam:<br /><br />know how you will finish a sentence before you start it &ndash; a lot of mistakes are caused by starting- stopping &ndash; starting again. The first bit is ok. So is the second bit. They just don&rsquo;t work together.<br /><br />good vocab tends to be precise vocab &ndash; precise vocab tends to come from examples<br /><br />some of the best grammar you can use comes from qualifying your ideas (modals, relatives and if clauses)- so if you want to use better grammar think about not having too many general statements, but using one statement that you explain in different ways <br /><br />You might note that there is a strong connection between these ideas and coherence, which is part of the reason why I started this lesson talking about it. If you want to focus on just one thing as you write your content paras, for many people coherence may be the best answer</p>",
