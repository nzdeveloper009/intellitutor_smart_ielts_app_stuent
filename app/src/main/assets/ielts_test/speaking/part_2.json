The series followed the main character, Ted, who recounted to his son and daughter the time when he met and got married to their mother. The special thing was this – all the events Ted had experienced with his best friends before meeting his wife were illustrated in a highly amusing way. For example, in one episode, Ted described his dates with a girlfriend whose name he had forgotten, so Ted and the other characters had to refer to her as “Blah-blah” all the time.</p>\n<p>Because of the characters’ eccentric humor and natural acting, this show made me laugh a lot. So, at present, whenever I feel stressed, I replay this series so that I can just put my feet up and have a good laugh.</p>",

She had a great\ninfluence on me and was a role model whom I look up to.\n<br><br>\nHer name is Yen and she taught me Math for 3 years of high school. She was in her 50s, and so she had a lot of teaching experience. Actually, we met each other almost everyday as she was also my form teacher. She cared about us as if we had been her sons and daughters. For example, she always brought some kinds of medicines so that whenever her students got a cold, coughed or something like that, she would give them the medicines immediately.\n<br><br>\nAbove all, I was most influenced by the way she taught us in class. Her thoroughness in teaching inspired me to study Math, even though I had not been interested in the subject before. Thanks to her effective teaching method, I was able to pass the university entrance exam with a high Math grade. Besides, I was also influenced by her lifestyle, which was so simple and worthy of respect that I really wanted to copy her. As she is a warm-hearted person, she always gave us advice about any problems we faced. At times, I felt that she was like my friend who I could share everything with.\n<br><br>\nAlthough we have now all graduated from high school, my friends and I often visit her at\nthe weekends to tell her about our daily life at university.<br>",

What surprised me the most was that there were various types of pizza and drinks; hence, it took me quite a long time to choose the food. After that, we talked with each other while waiting for the dishes. Some of my friends were studying at the same university, some had decided to get a job. And I was especially impressed by the decision of one friend to take a <strong>gap year.</strong> She said that as she <strong>had a strong passion for </strong>traveling, she would spend one year visiting lots of places.</p>\n<p>Then, the dishes were served. The pizza was <strong>out-of-this-world</strong> and the drinks were <strong>tasty</strong> although they were <strong>a bit pricey</strong>. We kept talking and enjoyed the meal and drinks for about two hours. Actually, meeting them reminded me of the time when we studied at high school and I&nbsp;realized that now we were all grown-up, we had our own plans to pursue. But we all promised to meet up regularly.</p>",

It was published in <strong>hard-cover</strong> version and there was a colourful illustration on the front which <strong>caught my eye</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">At first, although I was not much impressed by the novel’s preview, I still bought it and started to read the story <strong>right after</strong> getting home.

This novel told the story of an Italian imaginary character named Vito Corleone, who was a mafia boss in America after World War I. What attracted me in this story was the way the author described Vito’s tricks to survive in a chaotic society. Thanks to this novel, I learned a lot about the course of American history in that lawless period.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">After finishing this book, I read some more novels by Mario Puzo and they were all fascinating.

Today, I’m going to talk about a time when I taught mathematics to one of my friends.\n<br><br>\nIt’s been quite long, around 10 years. I was pursuing my Bachelor’s from Kurukshetra University. The course comprised three majors: mathematics, science and computer science. Mathematics was a challenging subject. Despite that I obtained excellent grades in mathematics. Sadly, my close friend, Rohit, didn’t get good grades in his first semester exams.  He was unable to understand the fundamentals of calculus and trigonometry. He asked me if I could help him. I willingly agreed.\n<br><br>\nI started teaching him in the evening. Initially, nothing seemed to move forward as Rohit didn’t have a strong foundation in maths. But, his willingness to learn kept us going. We kept on trying and after a lot of hard work for months, I could see a change in his level.\n<br><br>\nOverall, I loved sharing my knowledge with Rohit. This help wasn’t out of obligation but out of true friendship to boost his confidence and help him develop his mathematical skills. Being a student, teaching him was a tough task for me as well. At times I had to come up with a new idea to make him understand the question. He always gave his 100% and we managed to successfully clear all mathematics exams together. It was an achievement for both of us, and I will never regret helping a friend in need.<br>",
